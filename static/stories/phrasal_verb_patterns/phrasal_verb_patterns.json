  "clean_story": "Verbs with partners.  Meanings that shift.\n\"Phrasal verbs\" are verbs paired with small words like up, out, or off—changing their meaning entirely. Think of them as Lego bricks:<[silence:800ms]- the same base (take) builds take off (leave the ground), take up (start a hobby), or take apart (dismantle).\nMost languages stack words for new meanings. English does it aggressively. A single verb like get pairs with 20+ particles (get away, get by, get over), each acting like a different tool in a Swiss Army knife.\nThree patterns dominate:\n1. Inseparable (look after the kids)<[silence:800ms]- the particle after glues to look, never splitting.\n2. Separable (turn the TV off)<[silence:800ms]- the object (TV) can slide between turn and off.\n3. Three-word (catch up with friends)<[silence:800ms]- the particle (up) and preposition (with) lock together.\nNative speakers use these instinctively. Learners memorize lists—but context is key. \"Pick up\" means lift (a pen), collect (a package), or learn (a skill). The particle (up) hints at direction, completion, or intensity.\nThree related subjects are idiom origins, preposition flexibility, and how languages borrow structures.",
