  "clean_story": "Drugs. Body chemistry. The word pharmacology comes from Greek—pharmakon (drug) and logos (study)—because it’s the science of how substances change how living things work. Most people think of pharmacology as just \"making medicines,\" but it’s really about precision: finding the exact molecule that fits a problem like a key in a lock. A drug doesn’t just \"help\"—it binds to a specific protein, blocks a signal, or tricks cells into acting differently. For example, aspirin doesn’t just \"reduce pain\"; it stops an enzyme called COX-1, which cuts inflammation at its source. Too much, though, and it thins blood—useful for heart attacks, dangerous for cuts. Real-world impact? Penicillin, discovered in 1928, didn’t just \"fight infections\"—it targeted bacterial cell walls, leaving human cells untouched. Today, pharmacologists use computer models to predict how a drug will twist and bind before ever testing it on a person. One misplaced atom, and a life-saving drug becomes useless—or poison. The challenge? The body fights back. Bacteria mutate. Tumors resist. So pharmacology is also a race: designing drugs faster than diseases evolve. This leads to questions about adaptation, molecular warfare, and the thin line between remedy and toxin.",
