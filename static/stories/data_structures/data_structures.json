  "clean_story": "Data structures. Organized data. The term 'data structures' refers to how information is stored and arranged for efficient use. Think of it like a well-organized bookshelf where each book has a specific place, making it easy to find what you need. Data structures are the backbone of computer programs, determining how quickly and easily data can be accessed and manipulated. They come in various forms, each suited to different tasks. For example, a 'stack' works like a stack of plates—you can only add or remove the top plate, making it perfect for tasks like undoing actions in a program. A 'queue,' on the other hand, is like a line at a ticket counter—items are added at the back and removed from the front, ideal for managing tasks in order. Another common structure is the 'array,' which is like a list of items in a specific order, allowing quick access to any item by its position. These structures help computers handle large amounts of data efficiently, whether it's sorting a list of names, searching for a specific piece of information, or managing complex calculations. Without data structures, programs would be slower and less reliable, like trying to find a book in a disorganized library. Three related subjects are algorithms, the science of sorting and searching, and the impact of data structures on artificial intelligence.",
