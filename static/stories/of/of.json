  "clean_story": "\"Possession’s marker.  Relationship’s bridge. 'Of' is the invisible thread tying nouns to their owners, origins, or parts—like a label on a jar. It doesn’t act; it points. Most words describe actions or things. <[silence:1600ms]'Of' just connects. The leg of the table uses it to show possession. The city of Paris uses it to show origin. The speed of light uses it to link a quality to its source. Without it, language would need clunky workarounds. Instead of \"the cover of the book,\" you’d say \"the book’s cover\"—but even that hides a silent \"of. \"It’s the most used word in English after the and be. One study counted it 36,000 times in a 1-million-word sample. Yet it’s so quiet, you barely notice. Three related subjects are genitive case grammar, prepositional flexibility, and how languages drop ‘of’ entirely.",
