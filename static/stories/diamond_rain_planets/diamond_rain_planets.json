  "clean_story": "Carbon crushed. Skies glittering.\n\nThe name \"diamond rain\" comes from storms where diamonds form in the air and fall like hail.\n\nDeep inside planets like Neptune or Uranus, pressure squeezes methane into soot. The soot hardens into graphite, then diamond—like charcoal turning to gemstones under a hammer.\n\nThese diamonds grow heavy and sink, melting into liquid carbon rivers near the core. Scientists recreated this in labs using lasers to crush plastic into nanodiamonds.\n\nOn Saturn, lightning might spark diamond showers too. A single storm could drop thousands of carats—enough to fill a dump truck.\n\nThree related subjects are exoplanet atmospheres, high-pressure chemistry, and how planets store carbon.",
