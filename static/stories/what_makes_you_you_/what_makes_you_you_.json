  "clean_story": "**Your unique fingerprint. A mix of nature and nurture. **\n\nThe phrase \"what makes you you\" refers to the combination of traits, experiences, and choices that define who you are. It’s like a recipe with ingredients from your genes and your life experiences. Imagine you’re a tree. Your DNA is the seed that determines your basic shape and type, like whether you’ll be an oak or a maple. But your environment—like the soil, water, and sunlight—shapes how tall you grow and how your branches spread. Similarly, your personality, skills, and preferences are influenced by both your genes and the world around you. For example, your fingerprints are unique because of tiny details in your DNA and how your fingers developed in the womb. But your interests, like loving music or sports, come from a mix of your natural talents and the things you’ve learned and experienced. Even small things, like the way you laugh or the foods you love, are part of what makes you unique. These traits are shaped by your family, friends, and the choices you make every day. Three related subjects are how genes and environment shape behavior, the science of personality, and the role of free will in defining who we are.",
