  "clean_story": "**Questioning assumptions. Testing ideas. 'Critical thinking' means examining facts carefully before accepting them, like checking a recipe’s ingredients before cooking instead of trusting the picture on the box. Science relies on this skill to separate truth from guesswork. A scientist doesn’t just believe a claim because it sounds good—they ask: *How do we know?* For example, when people once thought the Earth was flat, critical thinkers demanded proof. They observed ships disappearing hull-first over the horizon and measured shadows at different locations, showing the planet’s curve. Good critical thinking follows steps: **observe, question, test, repeat. ** If a study claims drinking coffee boosts memory, a critical thinker checks: *Was the test group large enough?* *Did they account for sleep habits?* Without these checks, bad conclusions spread—like the false link between vaccines and autism, debunked after flawed research was exposed. Tools help sharpen this skill. **Peer review** lets other experts poke holes in a study before publication. **Controlled experiments** isolate variables—like testing a drug’s effect by giving half the group a placebo. Even simple habits, like asking *“What’s the evidence?”* or *“Could something else explain this?”*, prevent mistakes. Science isn’t about being right—it’s about being *less wrong* over time. Critical thinking turns guesses into reliable knowledge, one tested idea at a time. Ever wonder how biases sneak into research? Or why some “obvious” facts later turn out false? The line between skepticism and stubbornness can blur when emotions enter the lab.",
