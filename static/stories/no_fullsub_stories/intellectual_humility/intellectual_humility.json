  "clean_story": "\"Knowing you don’t know. A strength, not a weakness. The term 'intellectual humility' combines 'intellect' and 'humility,' meaning recognizing the limits of your knowledge without dismissing its value. \\n\\nWe often think of confidence as the key to success, but intellectual humility suggests that admitting what you don’t know can be just as powerful. It’s like being a detective who knows when to ask for help instead of guessing the answer. This mindset helps people learn faster, make better decisions, and work well with others. \\n\\nFor example, a scientist who admits they don’t understand a complex theory is more likely to ask the right questions and find the right experts to collaborate with. Similarly, a leader who acknowledges their gaps in knowledge can create a team where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas. Intellectual humility isn’t about doubting yourself—it’s about being open to growth. \\n\\nStudies show that people with intellectual humility are more likely to seek feedback, adapt to new information, and avoid stubbornly sticking to incorrect beliefs. They’re also better at resolving conflicts because they listen more than they argue. In a world full of strong opinions, this skill is invaluable. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the science of learning, the psychology of decision-making, and how curiosity shapes innovation. \"",
