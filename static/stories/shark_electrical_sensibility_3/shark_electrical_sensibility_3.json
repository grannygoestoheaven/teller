    "clean_story": "Bioelectric fields. Specialized pores. Sharks detect electrical signals through tiny, gel-filled organs called the ampullae of Lorenzini, clustered around their heads. These pores pick up the faint bioelectric fields generated by muscle movements of hidden prey, even in dark or murky waters. The sensitivity is extraordinary—sharks can sense voltage changes as small as a few billionths of a volt per centimeter. This ability isn’t just for hunting; it also aids in navigation, possibly helping them detect Earth’s magnetic field during long migrations. This system reflects millions of years of evolution, fine-tuning sharks into highly efficient predators. Their electroreception allows them to exploit environments where other predators struggle, from deep ocean trenches to shallow reefs. Yet, this sensory advantage faces modern challenges, as human-made electromagnetic noise increasingly disrupts natural signals. Three related subjects are the science of animal magnetoreception, the evolutionary advantages of electroreception in marine life, and the growing impact of electromagnetic pollution on aquatic ecosystems.",
