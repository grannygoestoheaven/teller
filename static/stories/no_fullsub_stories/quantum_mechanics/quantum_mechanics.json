' In this context, it refers to the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property, like energy or matter. Quantum mechanics describes how these tiny particles behave in ways that seem counterintuitive to our everyday experiences. \\n\\nImagine a coin spinning in the air. You'd expect it to land heads or tails, right? Now, imagine that coin is also a wave, existing in all its possible states at once—heads, tails, and everything in between. That's the essence of wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. \\n\\nConsider Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment where a cat in a box is simultaneously both alive and dead until observed. This isn't just a philosophical conundrum; it's a demonstration of quantum superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states at once. Only when we measure the cat—when we look inside the box—does it collapse into one state or the other. \\n\\nQuantum entanglement is another mind-bending concept. It's as if you have two dice, and no matter how far apart they are, when you roll them, they always show the same number. This instant connection, regardless of distance, is what Einstein famously referred to as 'spooky action at a distance. '\\n\\nThese principles have practical applications, too. Quantum computing uses the unique properties of quantum particles to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers.
