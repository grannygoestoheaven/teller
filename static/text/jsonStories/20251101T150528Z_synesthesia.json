Synesthesia is a neurological condition where stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory pathway.

The condition is estimated to affect approximately 4% of the population, though the prevalence can vary based on the type of synesthesia.  It is often hereditary, suggesting a genetic component to its occurrence.  Research into synesthesia has revealed that it is associated with increased connectivity between different regions of the brain.  This heightened connectivity may explain the cross-activation of sensory pathways.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that synesthetes have unique patterns of brain activity compared to non-synesthetes.
