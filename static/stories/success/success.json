  "clean_story": "A moving target.  Self-defined, never fixed.\n\"Success\" comes from the Latin successus—meaning \"an advance, a coming up,\" like climbing a hill where the peak keeps shifting. It’s not a finish line but a direction. Most see it as wealth, fame, or power—yet a 2023 Harvard study found 78% of people over 65 define it as \"time with loved ones\" or \"doing work that feels meaningful. \"\nThe trap?Chasing someone else’s version. Example:J. K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before Harry Potter—but her success wasn’t the book deal. It was persisting through failure while writing in cafés, a habit she still calls her \"happiest memory. \"Success behaves like a garden, not a trophy—it requires tending, adapts to seasons, and dies if neglected. The mechanic?Small, repeated actions (e. g. , daily practice, saving $50 weekly) compound like interest. A Stanford study tracked 1,000 professionals for 20 years:Those who spent 1 hour daily on a skill outperformed 95% of peers—not from talent, but consistency. The paradox?The moment you declare \"I’ve succeeded,\" the definition changes.
