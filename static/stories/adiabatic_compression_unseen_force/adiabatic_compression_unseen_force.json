    "clean_story": "Extreme pressure. Sudden cold. A diesel engine ignites without sparks. A spray can freezes in your hand. These aren’t separate phenomena—they’re the work of adiabatic compression, where gases surrender heat or cold not through exchange, but through sheer force of confinement. When air is compressed to a fraction of its volume, as in a diesel cylinder, temperatures soar past 500°C—enough to ignite fuel purely by pressure. Release that same air, and it plummets below freezing, as anyone who’s felt an aerosol can turn icy can attest. The rule is absolute: **PV^γ = constant**. Change the pressure or volume, and temperature *must* follow. The value of γ, unique to each gas, decides how harshly it resists. This isn’t just theory. It’s why industrial compressors need cooling systems, why storm clouds form as warm air rises and expands, and why no engine, no matter how advanced, can escape the tax of wasted heat. Adiabatic processes don’t bend; they define what’s possible. Three related subjects are the unexpected role of adiabatics in climate systems, the practical limits of compressed air as renewable storage, and how the Carnot Cycle uses these principles to dictate the ceiling of all energy conversion.",
