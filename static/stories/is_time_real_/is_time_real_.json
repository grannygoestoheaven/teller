  "clean_story": "\"Time's nature. A persistent illusion. 'Time' is a four-letter word that's been debated since ancient Greece. It's the fourth dimension, the river that flows in one direction, and the currency we spend daily. But is it real?\\n\\nPhilosophers argue time might be an illusion, a construct of our minds. They point to the 'block universe' theory, where all moments exist simultaneously, like frames of a film. In this view, our perception of time's flow is an illusion, created by our brains processing information sequentially. \\n\\nPhysicists, however, see time differently. To them, time is the fourth dimension, woven into the fabric of spacetime. It's the arrow that points from the Big Bang to the heat death of the universe. They measure it with precision, using atomic clocks that tick away seconds with unfailing regularity. \\n\\nConsider the cosmic microwave background radiation, the oldest light in the universe. It's been traveling for 13. 8 billion years, yet it arrives at our detectors at the same moment. This isn't because light is slow—it's because time is a dimension, not a flow. \\n\\nBut what about our experience of time? Why does it seem to pass quickly when we're enjoying ourselves, and slowly when we're bored? Neuroscientists suggest this is due to 'attention allocation. ' The more we focus on an experience, the more memories we create, and the longer it seems to last. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the philosophical debate over time's nature, the role of attention in our perception of time, and the quest to understand the fundamental physics of time's arrow. \"",
