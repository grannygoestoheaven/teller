  "clean_story": "\"Underground movement. Human behavior shaped by space. \"\n\n\"Subway design psychology\" studies how station layouts, colors, and signs influence how people move, feel, and decide—like an invisible hand guiding crowds.\n\n\nA subway isn’t just tunnels and trains. It’s a behavior lab where every tile, light, and staircase nudges riders without them noticing.\nTake wayfinding: London’s Underground uses a strict color-coded system (each line has its own hue) because tests showed travelers spot colored circles 40% faster than text alone. Tokyo’s stations pipe birdsong onto platforms to reduce suicide attempts—soundscapes alter mood as much as signs do.\nEven ceiling height plays a role. Low ceilings in New York’s older stations create urgency, speeding up foot traffic by 12%—while Paris’s vaulted Metro arches slow passengers, encouraging lingerers (and café sales).\nThe “edge effect” explains why people cluster near walls or pillars: Open spaces feel vulnerable, so designers place seats and info boards along edges to distribute crowds.\nSmall tweaks, massive impact. A yellow line on the platform reduces accidents. Mirrored walls in Stockholm’s stations cut vandalism by 30%—people behave better when they see themselves.\n\nThree related subjects are crowd fluid dynamics, urban soundscapes design, and color psychology in transit.",
