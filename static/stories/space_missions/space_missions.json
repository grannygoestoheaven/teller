  "clean_story": "\"Exploring the unknown. Pushing boundaries. The term 'space missions' refers to journeys beyond Earth's atmosphere, often to study other planets, stars, or the universe itself. It’s like sending a scout into uncharted territory to bring back information. Space missions can be crewed, like the Apollo missions that landed astronauts on the Moon, or uncrewed, like the Voyager probes that have traveled beyond our solar system. These missions help us understand our place in the cosmos and inspire technological advancements. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope has captured stunning images of distant galaxies, revealing secrets about the universe’s origins. Meanwhile, rovers like Perseverance on Mars search for signs of past life and test technologies for future human exploration. Space missions also drive innovation, leading to developments like GPS, satellite communication, and medical imaging. They’re a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity, pushing the limits of what we know and can achieve. \"",
