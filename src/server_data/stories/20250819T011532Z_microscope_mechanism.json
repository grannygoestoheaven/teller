  "clean": "Objective lenses.  Coarse adjustment.  Illuminator.  Microscope mechanisms involve precise components.  The objective lenses magnify the specimen.  Different magnification levels are achieved by rotating the nosepiece.  Lenses are made from high-quality glass.  The coarse adjustment knob moves the stage vertically.  It provides initial focus.  Fine adjustment refines the focus.  Both knobs are critical for clarity.  The illuminator is the light source.  It enhances specimen visibility.  Light intensity is adjustable.  Proper illumination is necessary for observation.  Three related subjects are optical physics, lens manufacturing, and specimen preparation.",
