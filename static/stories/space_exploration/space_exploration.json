  "clean_story": "\"Vast unknowns. Human curiosity. The word 'space exploration' combines 'space,' the emptiness beyond Earth, and 'exploration,' the act of discovering new places. It’s like sending probes to take pictures of a distant, mysterious land. \\n\\nWe often think of space exploration as just rockets and astronauts, but it’s also about robots, telescopes, and even math that helps us map the universe.

It’s also about understanding our own planet better, like how satellites help predict weather or monitor climate change. Without space exploration, we wouldn’t have GPS, which guides us on roads or helps planes fly safely. \\n\\nOf course, space exploration has challenges.
