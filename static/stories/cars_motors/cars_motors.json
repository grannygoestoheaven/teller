Controlled explosions. \"Car motor\" is short for internal combustion engine\u2014a machine that turns tiny, timed fires into motion. Imagine a bicycle pump, but instead of air, you\u2019re squeezing a mix of gasoline and oxygen\u2014then igniting it. That\u2019s what happens inside a car\u2019s cylinders, \u2013hundreds of times per minute.\nMost motors follow a four-step rhythm: suck (pull in fuel-air), squeeze (compress it), bang (spark plug fires), blow (exhaust escapes). The force from each \"bang\" pushes a piston down, \u2013which spins the crankshaft, \u2013which turns the wheels.\nA V8 engine does this 8 times per cycle\u2014like eight drummers hitting in perfect sync, but with fire. Turbochargers steal wasted exhaust energy to cram more air into the cylinders, forcing bigger explosions without bigger engines.\nEfficiency peaks at ~40%\u2014meaning 60% of your fuel\u2019s energy vanishes as heat or noise. Electric motors waste only ~10%, but gas engines still dominate for their energy density:1 gallon of gasoline holds as much power as 1,000 smartphone batteries.\nThree related subjects are hybrid engine trade-offs, diesel\u2019s torque advantage, and how jet engines repurpose explosions.", "timestamp": "20260301T101836Z"}
