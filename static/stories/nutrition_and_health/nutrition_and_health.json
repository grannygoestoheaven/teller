  "clean_story": "Nutrition fuels your body. Health reflects its balance. The word 'nutrition' comes from the Latin 'nutritio,' meaning nourishment. It’s the process of taking in and using food to stay healthy, like putting gas in a car to keep it running. Health is the result of good nutrition, but it’s also about how your body functions—like a well-tuned engine that runs smoothly. Imagine your body as a machine. The food you eat is the fuel that keeps it going. Just as a car needs the right type of gas to run efficiently, your body needs the right nutrients to stay healthy. These nutrients include vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates, which come from different foods like fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains. For example, eating an apple gives you fiber and vitamin C, while a piece of chicken provides protein for building muscles. But it’s not just about what you eat—it’s also about how much you eat and when. Eating too much or too little can lead to problems like obesity or malnutrition, just like putting too much or too little gas in a car can cause issues. Health isn’t just about physical well-being. It also includes mental health, which can be affected by what you eat. For instance, foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, can help improve brain function and mood. On the other hand, eating too much sugar can lead to energy crashes and feelings of anxiety. Three related subjects are the science of metabolism, how diet affects mental health, and the future of personalized nutrition.",
