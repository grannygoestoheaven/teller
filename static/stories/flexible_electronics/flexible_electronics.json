  "clean": "Organic semiconductors.  E-ink displays.  Self-healing circuits.  Flexible electronics represent a transformative shift in the design and application of electronic devices.  Unlike traditional rigid electronics, flexible electronics are constructed on pliable substrates, allowing them to bend, stretch, and conform to various shapes.  This adaptability opens up new possibilities for integration into everyday objects, from wearable technology to rollable displays.  The development of organic semiconductors has been pivotal in this field, offering materials that can be processed at low temperatures and printed onto flexible surfaces.  The application of flexible electronics spans a wide array of industries.  In healthcare, they enable the creation of wearable sensors that monitor vital signs continuously and unobtrusively.  These devices can adhere to the skin like a temporary tattoo, providing real-time data without restricting movement.  In consumer electronics, flexible displays have revolutionized the design of smartphones and tablets, allowing for devices that can fold or roll to fit into small spaces.  E-ink technology, used in flexible displays, offers low power consumption and high visibility, even in direct sunlight.  Research into self-healing circuits is advancing the durability of flexible electronics.  These circuits can repair themselves after damage, significantly extending the lifespan of devices and reducing electronic waste.  The integration of nanomaterials, such as graphene, enhances the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of flexible electronics, making them more reliable and efficient.  As these technologies mature, they promise to redefine the boundaries of how electronic devices are used and perceived.  Three related subjects are printed electronics, stretchable batteries, and nanomaterials in electronics.",
