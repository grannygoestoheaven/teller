  "clean_story": "\"Managing hardware. Running software. The term 'operating system' refers to the software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. \\nOperating systems are essential for modern computing. They handle tasks like managing memory, processing input and output, and controlling peripheral devices. Without an operating system, a computer would be unable to run applications or perform basic functions. \\nOne of the most well-known operating systems is Microsoft Windows. It was first released in 1985 and has since become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. Windows is known for its user-friendly interface and extensive software compatibility. \\nAnother popular operating system is macOS, developed by Apple. It is designed specifically for Apple's hardware and is known for its sleek design and seamless integration with other Apple devices. macOS is often praised for its stability and performance. \\nLinux is another major player in the operating system market. It is an open-source operating system, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to modify and distribute. Linux is known for its flexibility and is often used in servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems. \\nOperating systems have evolved significantly over the years. Early operating systems were simple and could only run one task at a time. Modern operating systems, however, can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, thanks to advancements in multitasking and virtual memory. \\nThree related subjects are the history of computing, the evolution of software, and the impact of open-source software on technology. \"",
