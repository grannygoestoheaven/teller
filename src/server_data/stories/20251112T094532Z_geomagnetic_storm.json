  "clean": "Solar wind. Magnetosphere. Auroras. Geomagnetic storms occur when solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun, interacts with Earth's magnetosphere. This interaction can cause disturbances in the magnetic field, leading to a variety of effects on both natural and human-made systems. The intensity of these storms is measured using the K-index, which quantifies the level of geomagnetic activity. During strong storms, the magnetosphere becomes compressed, allowing more solar particles to penetrate the atmosphere. One of the most visible effects of geomagnetic storms is the enhancement of auroras, also known as the Northern and Southern Lights. These natural light displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, causing them to emit light. Auroras become more widespread and visible at lower latitudes during intense geomagnetic activity. While visually captivating, these storms can also disrupt communication systems and power grids. Geomagnetic storms can induce electric currents in power lines, potentially leading to voltage instability and transformer damage. Satellite operations are also at risk, as increased radiation can interfere with onboard electronics and navigation systems. Additionally, radio communications can experience significant disruptions due to ionospheric disturbances caused by these storms. Understanding and predicting geomagnetic storms is important for mitigating their impact on technology. Research continues to improve forecasting models for geomagnetic storms, utilizing data from solar observations and space weather monitoring. Scientists aim to provide more accurate predictions to protect infrastructure and communication networks. Three related subjects are solar flares, space weather forecasting, and magnetosphere research.",
