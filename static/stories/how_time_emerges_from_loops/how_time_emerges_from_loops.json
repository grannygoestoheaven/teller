  "clean_story": "Repeating cycles.  Time’s hidden engine.\n\n\nThe phrase \"time emerges from loops\" suggests that what we call \"time\" might not be a straight line but something built by things happening over and over—like frames in a film.\n\n\nImagine a spinning wheel. - Each turn looks the same, but if you count the spins, you measure time. Now think of a clock. - Its ticking is just a loop of a pendulum or quartz vibrating. The \"now\" you feel is just one tick in an endless chain.\n\n\nPhysicists study this in loop quantum gravity, where space itself might be made of tiny, interconnected loops. Like a fabric woven from threads that twist back on themselves. If you zoom into a single thread, you’d see it’s not moving forward—just repeating a pattern. Time, then, isn’t a river. It’s the counting of how many times the loop completes.\n\n\nA real-world hint?- Your heartbeat. Each pulse is nearly identical, yet the sequence creates your lifespan. Or a planet orbiting a star. - One year is just one full loop. Even your breath—inhale, exhale, repeat—turns air into a metronome.\n\n\nThis idea flips the script:- Time isn’t a thing flowing past us. It’s what we name when we stack identical moments and call the pile \"progress. \"\n\n\nThree related subjects are quantum foam structure,  how clocks trick the brain,  and why memory feels like time.",
