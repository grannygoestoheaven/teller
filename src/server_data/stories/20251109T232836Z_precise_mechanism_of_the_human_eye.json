  "clean": "Photoreceptors.  Optic nerve.  Retinal layers.  The human eye operates through a precise mechanism that begins with the entry of light through the cornea.  This transparent, dome-shaped surface refracts light, directing it towards the pupil.  The iris, a muscular structure, adjusts the pupil size to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.  Behind the pupil lies the lens, which fine-tunes focus by changing shape, a process known as accommodation.  Once light passes through the lens, it reaches the retina, a multi-layered tissue at the back of the eye.  The retina contains photoreceptors, specifically rods and cones, which convert light into electrical signals.  Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones detect color and detail in brighter settings.  These signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve.  The optic nerve acts as a conduit, carrying visual information to the brain's visual cortex.  Here, the brain processes and interprets these signals, allowing us to perceive images.  This entire process occurs almost instantaneously, enabling seamless visual perception.  Each component of the eye works in concert to ensure accurate image formation.
