Ears for the unseen ocean. \"Underwater acoustics\" just means studying how sound travels through water\u2014because light fades fast, but sound carries for miles. Whales don\u2019t shout across oceans with megaphones. They pulse low-frequency moans\u2014some under 20 Hz\u2014that ripple through seawater like vibrations in a guitar string. A blue whale\u2019s call can cross the Atlantic in hours, louder than a jet engine but tuned to frequencies humans barely hear. Here\u2019s the trick:Water is 800 times denser than air, so sound moves four times faster\u20141,500 meters per second. No echoes bounce off empty space. Instead, they ricochet off thermoclines (temperature layers), salt gradients, even schools of fish. Tools exploit this:Sonar pings like a dolphin\u2019s clicks, measuring return time to map seafloors or detect submarines. Hydrophones\u2014underwater microphones\u2014listen for iceberg cracks in the Arctic or volcanic rumbles near Tonga. Precision matters:A 1\u00b0C temperature shift can bend sound 100 meters off-course over 1 km. Sperm whales use this, angling clicks to \"see\" squid in total darkness. Three related subjects are animal echolocation tactics, deep-sea noise pollution effects, and how fiber optics replaced sonar cables.", "timestamp": "20260301T100824Z"}
