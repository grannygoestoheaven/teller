  "clean_story": "Decimal system.  Indian mathematicians.  Transmission to the Islamic world.  Evolution and adaptation.  The creation of the Arabic numbers, known today as the digits 0 through 9, finds its origins in ancient India.  Indian mathematicians developed a decimal positional number system that included a symbol for zero, a concept that was revolutionary at the time.  This system was documented in texts like the Brahmasphutasiddhanta by Brahmagupta, who lived in the 7th century.  The Indian numerals were not only a practical tool for calculations but also a significant intellectual advancement, setting the stage for future mathematical developments.  The transmission of these numerals to the Islamic world was facilitated through trade and scholarly exchanges.  By the 9th century, scholars in the Abbasid Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad, began to adopt and adapt the Indian numeral system.  Al-Khwarizmi, a Persian mathematician, played a pivotal role in this process by writing a treatise that introduced and explained the Indian numerals to the Arab world.  His works laid the foundation for the numeral system to be integrated into Islamic mathematics and subsequently spread throughout the Middle East.  As the system was embraced by the Islamic world, it underwent further evolution and adaptation.  The numerals were modified to suit the Arabic script, resulting in the symbols that are recognized today as Arabic numerals.  This adaptation was not merely cosmetic; it was a testament to the dynamic nature of cultural and intellectual exchange.  The new numeral system facilitated more complex calculations and contributed to advancements in various scientific fields.  The spread of Arabic numerals to Europe occurred through translations of Arabic mathematical texts during the Middle Ages.  By the 12th century, these numerals began to replace Roman numerals in Europe, thanks in part to scholars like Fibonacci, who recognized their computational efficiency.  The adoption of Arabic numerals in Europe marked a significant shift in mathematical practice and education, paving the way for the development of modern mathematics.  Three related subjects are the history of the decimal system, the role of zero in mathematics, and the influence of Islamic scholars on European mathematics.",
