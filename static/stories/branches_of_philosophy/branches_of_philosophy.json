  "clean_story": "Philosophy’s big questions. Branches explore them. The word 'philosophy' comes from Greek, meaning 'love of wisdom. ' It’s like a map for understanding life, the universe, and everything in between. Philosophy is divided into branches, each focusing on different questions. Imagine a tree with many limbs, each reaching in a unique direction. One branch might ask, 'What is real?' while another wonders, 'How should we live?'Take metaphysics, for example. It’s like peeling back the layers of reality to see what’s underneath. Questions like 'Does free will exist?' or 'What is time?' fall under this branch. It’s the foundation of philosophy, dealing with the big, abstract ideas that shape our understanding of the world. Ethics is another branch, focusing on how we should behave. It’s like a guidebook for making good choices. Questions like 'Is it ever okay to lie?' or 'What makes an action right or wrong?' are part of ethics. This branch helps us navigate moral dilemmas and live in harmony with others. Logic is the branch that teaches us how to think clearly and argue effectively. It’s like learning the rules of a game so you can play it well. Logic helps us spot flaws in arguments and build strong, convincing cases. It’s essential for philosophy and many other fields, from science to law. Epistemology is the study of knowledge. It asks, 'What do we know, and how do we know it?' It’s like a detective story, where philosophers examine the clues to figure out what’s true. This branch helps us.",
