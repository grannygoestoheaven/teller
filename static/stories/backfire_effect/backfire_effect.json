  "clean_story": "\"Misinformation spreads. Persuasion backfires. The backfire effect describes how correcting false beliefs can sometimes make them stronger. It’s like trying to remove a stain by scrubbing harder—sometimes, you just push it deeper. \\nImagine telling someone that a popular myth is false. Instead of changing their mind, they might double down on the belief. This happens because people often see corrections as personal attacks, triggering defensiveness. \\nResearch shows this effect is stronger when the topic is emotionally charged, like politics or health. For example, telling someone vaccines cause autism might make them more convinced of it, despite overwhelming evidence against it. \\nThe backfire effect highlights why simply presenting facts isn’t always enough. Effective communication requires understanding the emotional and psychological factors at play. \\nThree related subjects are cognitive dissonance, the role of emotions in decision-making, and how social media amplifies misinformation. \"",
