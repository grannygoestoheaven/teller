  "clean_story": "Choices with consequences.  A hinge for possibilities. \"If\" is a two-letter pivot—the smallest word that splits reality into branches. It doesn’t just ask \"what could happen?\"It builds invisible bridges between now and what hasn’t happened yet. Think of it like a train switch:One flick sends the engine left to a storm, right to sunshine. No movement, no change—just the track already laid. \"If\" works in three layers: First, the condition (\"If it rains\").\nSecond, the split (\"then the game moves indoors\").\nThird, the shadow outcome (\"or we play in mud\").\nIt’s not prediction—it’s a tool for holding two futures at once. Example:A chef tastes soup. If—salt is missing—they add it. If—it’s oversalted—they dilute. The word forces them to act before the problem exists. Even computers rely on it. Every \"if\" statement in code is a fork in the road:If password = \"1234\", grant access. Else, lock the door. Three related subjects are counterfactual thinking, decision tree logic, and how language shapes probability.",
