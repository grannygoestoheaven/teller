  "clean": "Acoustic levitation.  Standing wave nodes.  Non-contact manipulation.  Acoustic levitation employs sound waves to suspend small particles or droplets in mid-air.  This phenomenon occurs when sound waves create standing wave patterns, producing nodes where the sound pressure is minimal.  Objects can be trapped at these nodes, effectively levitating them without physical contact.  The technique is precise, allowing for the manipulation of objects in a controlled environment.  The process involves generating high-frequency sound waves, typically in the ultrasonic range, which are inaudible to the human ear.  These sound waves exert pressure on the object, counteracting gravitational forces.  By adjusting the frequency and amplitude of the waves, researchers can control the position and stability of the levitated object.  This capability is particularly useful in handling delicate or hazardous materials.  Applications of acoustic levitation are diverse, ranging from scientific research to industrial processes.  It is used in the study of non-contact material processing, such as the formation of new materials without contamination.  Additionally, it offers potential in the pharmaceutical industry for the manipulation of small biological samples.  The technique also finds use in space research, where it aids in simulating microgravity conditions.  Three related subjects are ultrasonic transducers, standing wave patterns, and non-contact material handling.",
