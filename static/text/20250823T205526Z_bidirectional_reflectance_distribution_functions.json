  "clean": "Spectral albedo.  Surface scattering.  Angular dependence.  The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is a mathematical model that describes how light is reflected at an opaque surface.  It defines the relationship between the incoming light and the reflected light at different angles.  The BRDF is expressed as a function of four variables: the angles of incidence and reflection, both in azimuth and elevation.  This function is fundamental in understanding the behavior of light as it interacts with surfaces, providing insights into the surface's texture and material properties.  BRDF is widely used in computer graphics, remote sensing, and optical engineering.  In computer graphics, it helps in rendering realistic images by simulating how light interacts with virtual objects.  Remote sensing applications utilize BRDF to interpret satellite imagery, allowing for better analysis of the Earth's surface.  In optical engineering, BRDF measurements are crucial for designing materials with specific reflective properties.  The measurement of BRDF involves capturing data from various angles using specialized equipment.  This data is then used to create models that predict how light will behave when interacting with different materials.  These models are essential for applications that require precise control over light reflection, such as in the development of coatings and paints.  The accuracy of BRDF models is vital for ensuring that simulations and analyses are reliable.  Three related subjects are spectral albedo, surface scattering, and angular dependence.",
