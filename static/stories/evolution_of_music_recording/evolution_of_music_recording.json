  "clean_story": "Captured sound. Frozen music. The phrase \"music recording\" simply means trapping sound so it can be played back later—like bottling a song to uncork it anytime. Before recordings, music vanished the moment it stopped. If you missed a concert, it was gone forever, like a ripple in water. Then came the **phonograph** in 1877, invented by Thomas Edison. It worked like a needle tracing grooves on a spinning cylinder, the way your finger follows bumps on a braille sign. Speak or sing into the horn, and the vibrations carved patterns into tin foil. Play it back, and the needle would wiggle through those grooves, recreating the sound—weak and scratchy, but alive. By the 1920s, **electrical recording** replaced pure mechanics. Microphones turned sound into electrical signals, like translating a whisper into Morse code. These signals cut deeper, smoother grooves into vinyl records, making music louder and clearer. A 78 RPM record could now hold a 3-minute song—long enough for jazz bands or opera arias to fit on one side. Then came **magnetic tape** in the 1940s, borrowed from German radio engineers. Tape worked like a cassette in a VCR: sound was converted to magnetic patterns on plastic ribbon. Unlike records, tape could be **edited**. Musicians could splice sections together, fix mistakes, or layer tracks—like cutting and pasting paragraphs in a letter. The Beatles’ *Sgt. Pepper’s* (1967) used tape loops to create trippy effects, proving music could now be **built**, not just captured. Digital recording arrived in the 1970s, turning sound into numbers. A CD stores music as tiny pits on a disc, read by a laser—like scanning a barcode to reconstruct a symphony. No hisses, no scratches, just perfect copies. Then MP3s in the 1990s compressed those numbers further, shrinking a 4-minute song to 4 megabytes—small enough to email or pirate. Today, **streaming** dominates. Services like Spotify don’t even store full songs on your device. They send data in real-time, like a faucet pouring water only when you turn it on. Algorithms now \"master\" tracks, balancing volume and tone automatically—something that once required a human ear and a $10,000 machine. From wax cylinders to cloud libraries, each leap made music more portable, editable, and accessible. Yet the core idea remains: **preserving a moment so it can be rel.",
