  "clean_story": "Connection without separation.  A bridge in language. \"With\" is a preposition—one of the oldest tools in English, tracing back to Old English wiþ, meaning \"against\" or \"opposite. \"Yet it evolved into something softer—a word that ties things together. It’s the invisible thread in sentences. Like glue holding \"coffee with milk\" or \"walking with a friend,\" it shows relationship without fuss. No other word does this so quietly. Grammarians call it a \"comitative\"—fancy for \"accompanying. \"But its power lies in simplicity:It turns lone actions into shared ones. \"She laughed\" becomes \"She laughed with him\"—now there’s warmth. Even math uses it:In equations, \"5 with 3\" might imply pairing, though symbols like \"+\" took over. Yet in code, `with` still opens doors—like Python’s `with open(file)`—handling tasks neatly before closing them. Three related subjects are prepositional logic, language’s silent helpers, and how words shape thought.",
