  "clean_story": "\"Women’s rights. A long fight. The word 'feminism' comes from 'feminine,' meaning it’s about women’s rights and equality. It’s like a movement that says, 'Women deserve the same chances as men. 'For centuries, women were often treated as second-class citizens. They couldn’t vote, own property, or even go to school in many places. Imagine being told you can’t have a say in how your country is run, just because of your gender. That was the reality for women in many parts of the world until the 20th century. One of the biggest milestones was the women’s suffrage movement. In 1920, the 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution finally gave American women the right to vote. But this wasn’t just a U. S. issue—women around the world fought for their voices to be heard. In the UK, for example, women like Emmeline Pankhurst led protests and even went to jail to demand voting rights, which they finally won in 1918. Women also faced challenges in the workplace. For a long time, jobs like teaching or nursing were considered 'appropriate' for women, while higher-paying jobs were off-limits. But women like Rosie the Riveter during World War II showed that they could do any job, breaking down barriers. Today, women are CEOs, scientists, and leaders in every field, but the fight for equal pay and opportunities continues. Education was another battleground. In the 19th century, many schools didn’t accept girls, and those that did often taught them only 'domestic skills. ' But women like Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to earn a medical degree in the U. S. , proved that women could excel in any field. Today, women make up more than half of college graduates in many countries, showing how far we’ve come. Three related subjects are the ongoing fight for gender equality, the role of women in politics, and how women’s contributions have shaped history. \"",
