  "clean_story": "Electrical impulses. Sinoatrial node. Autonomic nervous system. Chemical signals. The heart's rhythmic beating is orchestrated by a series of electrical impulses. At the helm of this process is the sinoatrial node, a small cluster of cells located in the right atrium. Often referred to as the heart's natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node generates electrical signals that initiate each heartbeat. These impulses travel through the heart's conduction system, prompting the atria and ventricles to contract in a coordinated manner. The autonomic nervous system plays a significant role in regulating heart rate. It comprises two main components: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic system increases heart rate and force of contraction during stress or physical activity. Conversely, the parasympathetic system decreases heart rate during restful states. This dynamic balance ensures the heart adapts to varying physiological demands. Chemical signals also influence heart rate. Hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the adrenal glands, accelerate heart rate and enhance cardiac output. Additionally, electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, calcium, and sodium, are vital for proper electrical activity and muscle contraction in the heart. Disruptions in these chemical signals can lead to arrhythmias, affecting the heart's ability to beat efficiently. Three related subjects are the impact of exercise on heart rate, the role of electrolytes in cardiac function, and the influence of stress on cardiovascular health.",
