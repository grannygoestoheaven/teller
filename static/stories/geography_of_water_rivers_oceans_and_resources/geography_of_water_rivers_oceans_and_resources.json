  "clean_story": "\"Water shapes our world. Rivers, oceans, and resources define life. The word 'geography' comes from Greek words meaning 'earth' and 'write. ' It’s the study of how water, land, and people interact. We often think of rivers as just paths for boats, but they’re also lifelines for cities and ecosystems. The Nile, for example, has supported civilizations for thousands of years by providing water, food, and transportation. Oceans, covering most of Earth, regulate climate and support marine life, which produces half the oxygen we breathe. They’re also vast highways for trade and travel. Water resources, like groundwater and lakes, are essential for drinking, farming, and industry. But they’re not endless—droughts and pollution threaten them. Managing these resources carefully is crucial for survival. Three related subjects are how climate change affects water supplies, the technology used to clean polluted water, and the future of sustainable farming in dry regions. \"",
