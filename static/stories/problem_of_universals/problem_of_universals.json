  "clean_story": "\"Universals. Abstract properties. The term 'universals' refers to qualities or properties that multiple distinct entities can share. This philosophical problem questions whether universals exist independently of the objects that exhibit them. \\n\\nTraditionally, universals are perceived as either real entities existing beyond our perception or as mere names we assign to common features. Realism posits that universals exist independently, like the concept of 'redness' existing beyond any red object. Nominalism, on the other hand, argues that universals are simply labels for grouping similar objects, without independent existence. \\n\\nConsider the color red. In realism, 'redness' is a universal that exists whether or not any red objects are present. In nominalism, 'redness' is just a convenient term for describing objects that appear similar in color. This debate impacts fields like mathematics, where numbers can be seen as universals or mere symbols. \\n\\nThe problem of universals influences how we understand language, science, and metaphysics. It challenges us to consider whether abstract concepts have a reality of their own or are constructs of human thought. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the nature of abstract objects, the philosophy of language, and the implications of realism versus nominalism in scientific theory. \"",
