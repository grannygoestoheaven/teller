  "clean_story": "\"Fundamental forces. Particles interact. The Standard Model of Physics is like the rulebook for how tiny particles behave and how forces work in the universe. It explains everything from why atoms stick together to how light travels. Imagine the universe as a giant game of LEGO, where each piece follows specific rules to build everything around us. The Standard Model identifies the basic building blocks—like quarks and electrons—and the forces that hold them together, such as electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force. It’s like knowing the ingredients and recipes needed to cook any dish in the world. For example, when you turn on a light, the electrons in the wire move because of electromagnetism, one of the forces described by the Standard Model. This model also helps scientists predict how particles will behave in experiments, like smashing atoms together in particle accelerators. However, the Standard Model doesn’t explain everything, like gravity or dark matter, which are still mysteries. Three related subjects are the search for a unified theory of everything, the role of dark matter in the universe, and how quantum mechanics challenges our understanding of reality. \"",
