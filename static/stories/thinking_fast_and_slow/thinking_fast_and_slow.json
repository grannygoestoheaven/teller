  "tagged_story_for_tts": "**Two ways to think. One fast, one slow.**\n\nThe title *Thinking, Fast and Slow* comes from psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s discovery that our brains operate like two pilots: **System 1** (fast, automatic) and **System 2** (slow, effortful). The names describe their speed—not their smarts.\n\nMost people assume good decisions come from careful thought. But Kahneman’s work—rooted in decades of experiments with Amos Tversky—showed how often we trust **System 1’s shortcuts**, even when they mislead us. Example: If someone asks, *\"Is 2 + 2 = 5?\"*, your brain rejects it instantly (System 1). But solving *17 × 24* forces you to pause and calculate (System 2). The first feels easy; the second feels like work.\n\nThese shortcuts aren’t random. They’re **cognitive biases**—patterns like *\"anchoring\"* (relying too much on the first number you hear) or *\"loss aversion\"* (fearing losses more than valuing gains). In one test, doctors given the same patient data recommended surgery 72% of the time when told *\"90% survival rate\"* but only 50% when told *\"10% mortality rate.\"* Same facts, different framing—System 1 reacted to the words, not the math.\n\nThe book’s power isn’t just exposing flaws; it’s showing how to **spot them in action**. A trader might avoid selling a losing stock because *\"it’ll rebound\"* (System 1’s optimism), while System 2 would check the data. Or a job interviewer might hire someone *\"with a firm handshake\"* (a bias called the *\"halo effect\"*) instead of reviewing their resume.\n\nKahneman’s experiments proved these errors aren’t rare—they’re **built into how we think**. Even chess masters, when shown a board with pieces placed randomly, will suggest *\"strong\"* moves for positions that don’t exist. Their System 1 recognizes patterns; it doesn’t question them.\n\nThis isn’t about dumb vs. smart. It’s about **when to trust your gut—and when to slow down**. A fire alarm’s blare needs System 1. Choosing a mortgage needs System 2. The trick? Noticing which pilot is flying.\n\nWhat else shapes our choices without us realizing? **How memory tricks us into rewriting the past. Why experts overestimate their predictions. The hidden math behind \"good enough\" decisions.**",
