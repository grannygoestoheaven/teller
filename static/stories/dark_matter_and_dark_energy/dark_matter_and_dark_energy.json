  "clean_story": "Dark matter. Dark energy. The words 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' describe invisible forces shaping the universe. They’re called 'dark' because we can’t see them, but we know they’re there because of their effects. Imagine the universe as a giant cosmic dance. Galaxies are like dancers moving in patterns, but something invisible is pulling them together—dark matter. It’s like an invisible glue holding galaxies intact, even though we can’t see it. Dark matter makes up about 27% of the universe, but we still don’t know what it’s made of. Then there’s dark energy, which is even more mysterious. It’s like an invisible force pushing the universe apart, making galaxies move faster and faster. Dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe, and it’s why the universe is expanding. Without it, the universe might have collapsed long ago. Scientists study dark matter and dark energy by watching how galaxies move and how light travels through space. They use powerful telescopes and detectors to look for clues, but so far, these forces remain hidden. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces. Three related subjects are the mysteries of black holes, the search for extraterrestrial life, and the origins of the universe.",
