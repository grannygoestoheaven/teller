  "clean_story": "Latin roots. Middle English. Linguistic evolution. Semantic shifts. The word 'single' traces its origins to the Latin term 'singulus,' meaning 'one' or 'alone. ' This Latin root is foundational, denoting individuality and singularity. As the term evolved, it was absorbed into Old French as 'sengle,' maintaining a similar meaning. The transition from Latin to Old French marks the initial phase of the word's journey into English. In Middle English, the word 'single' emerged around the 14th century, derived from the Old French 'sengle. ' During this period, the term was used to describe something that was unaccompanied or solitary. The Middle English adaptation retained much of the original Latin meaning, emphasizing the concept of one or alone. This linguistic evolution highlights the continuity of the term's core meaning across languages. Over time, the word 'single' expanded in usage, encompassing various contexts beyond mere numerical singularity. It began to describe not only objects and people but also actions and states, such as being unmarried or unaccompanied. This semantic shift demonstrates the adaptability of language and how words can acquire broader meanings. The word's versatility today reflects its rich etymological history. Three related subjects are the etymology of 'unique,' the history of the word 'individual,' and the evolution of 'solitary. '",
