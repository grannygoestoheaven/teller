  "clean_story": "Sound’s hidden power. Music shapes the mind. The term psychology of music studies how melodies, rhythms, and harmonies affect emotions, memory, and even physical movement. Most people think of music as just entertainment. But it’s far more—it’s a tool that rewires the brain. A fast tempo speeds up heartbeats, like sprinting to a drum. Slow melodies lower stress, the way deep breaths calm a racing mind. Studies show listening to Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos briefly boosts spatial reasoning—called the \"Mozart Effect.\" Yet the real power isn’t in genius composers. It’s in repetition. Ever get a song stuck in your head? That’s your brain’s auditory loop—a mental jukebox replaying fragments. Advertisers exploit this. Jingles use simple, repetitive hooks to lodge in memory. McDonald’s \"I’m Lovin’ It\" wasn’t just catchy—it was engineered. Music also binds groups. Soldiers march in sync to drums. Churches sing hymns to unite. Even infants synchronize movements to rhythm before they can walk. Oxytocin—the \"trust hormone\"—spikes when people make music together. It’s why choirs feel like family. Then there’s frisson—the chills from a sudden musical climax. Like goosebumps when a singer hits a high note. Brain scans reveal it triggers the same reward centers as food or love. But music’s dark side exists too. Loud, aggressive sounds raise cortisol, the stress hormone. Some retail stores use high-frequency tones to deter loitering teens—sound they can hear, but adults can’t. From lullabies to war chants, music is never just noise. It’s a lever for the mind. Memory and sound. Emotion as a composer’s tool. The science of why we hate—or love—a song on first listen.",
