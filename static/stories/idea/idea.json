  "clean_story": "Mental spark.  Bridge to unseen. \"Idea\" traces back to the Greek idein—meaning \"to see. \"Not with eyes, but with the mind’s lens. An idea starts as a flicker—a neuron firing in a new pattern. Like striking flint: no flame yet, just potential. The brain tests it, turning the spark into a sketch—rough, incomplete. Example:Archimedes’ bathwater didn’t shout \"Eureka!\"His submerged body displaced water—an observation. His idea was the leap: \"This could measure gold’s purity. \"Ideas demand two tools:Association—linking unrelated facts (e. g. , \"bird flight + steam engine = airplane\"). Constraint—limits force creativity (e. g. , \"Build a computer… but only with relays\"). Most ideas die untried. The survivors?Those paired with action—like Gutenberg’s wine press repurposed to print Bibles. Or Marie Curie’s pitchblende scraps, yielding radium. Three related subjects are thought experiments, serendipity in science, and how sleep fuels insights.",
