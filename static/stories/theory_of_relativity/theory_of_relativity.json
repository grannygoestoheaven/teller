  "clean_story": "Time’s stretch. Space’s bend. The *theory of relativity* splits into two parts: *special* (1905) and *general* (1915). The name fits because it describes how motion, time, and gravity aren’t absolute—they change based on who’s observing and how fast they’re moving. Most people know relativity from Einstein’s wild hair or the equation *E=mc²*, but its real power is in how it reshapes everyday assumptions. Imagine you’re on a train moving at half the speed of light. To someone standing on the platform, your watch ticks slower, and the train appears slightly squished—like a photo stretched the wrong way. Yet to *you*, everything on the train feels normal. This isn’t a trick of perception; time and space actually warp at extreme speeds. Special relativity proved this with a simple rule: the speed of light (300,000 km/s) never changes, no matter how fast *you’re* moving. If you chase a light beam in a spaceship at 99% light speed, the beam still zooms away at 300,000 km/s—not 1% slower. To make this math work, time slows down for you, and distances shrink in the direction you’re traveling. GPS satellites account for this daily—their clocks tick 0. 000000007 seconds faster per day than Earth’s because they’re moving at 14,000 km/h. Without adjusting for relativity, your phone’s location would drift kilometers off course. General relativity added gravity to the mix, redefining it not as a force but as a curve in space and time. Picture a bowling ball on a trampoline: it creates a dip, and smaller balls (like planets) roll toward it. The sun’s mass bends spacetime like that dip, and Earth “falls” around it in an orbit. This was confirmed in 1919 when stars near the sun during an eclipse appeared shifted—their light bent by the sun’s gravity, exactly as Einstein predicted. Relativity isn’t just theory. Your car’s GPS, the precision of atomic clocks, and even the way your smartphone syncs with satellites all rely on its equations. Black holes, gravitational waves, and the expanding universe all bow to its rules. Quantum mechanics’ unpredictability. Cosmic inflation’s first moments. The search for a theory unifying all forces.",
