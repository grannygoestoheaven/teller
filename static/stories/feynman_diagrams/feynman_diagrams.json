  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Particle interactions. Visual shorthand.\n\nThe name Feynman diagrams honors physicist Richard Feynman, who devised them in the 1940s to simplify quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations—turning dense math into sketches of particle behavior.\n\nOften mistaken for literal paths, these diagrams are mathematical recipes: lines represent particles (straight for matter, wavy for force-carriers like photons), while vertices mark interactions governed by probability rules. A single diagram can encode pages of integrals—like a musical score for particles, where each symbol dictates a term in the equation.\n\nExample: An electron emitting a photon appears as a straight line sprouting a wiggle. The diagram’s shape directly translates to the calculation’s structure, with loops (closed paths) introducing quantum corrections. Tools like JaxoDraw automate rendering, while experiments at CERN validate their predictions to 1 part in 10 billion.\n\nTheir precision exposed hidden symmetries, leading to the Standard Model. Yet they’re not just tools—they’re a language, revealing how particles \"communicate\" via forces.\n\nThree related subjects are quantum field theory, path integral formulation, and symmetry in physics.",
