  "clean_story": "\"Boundaries of understanding. Limits of perception. The term 'limits of knowledge' in Kantian philosophy refers to the boundaries beyond which human understanding cannot extend. Immanuel Kant, an 18th-century philosopher, argued that while we can know phenomena—things as they appear to us—we cannot know noumena, or things-in-themselves. \\n\\nKant’s philosophy is often perceived as complex and abstract. However, it fundamentally addresses a practical issue: the distinction between what we can experience and what lies beyond our sensory perception. Kant proposed that our knowledge is limited by the structures of our mind, which shape our experiences. For instance, we perceive time and space not because they exist independently, but because our minds are structured to interpret experiences through these dimensions. \\n\\nConsider the example of gravity. We can observe its effects, like an apple falling from a tree, but the true nature of gravity itself remains beyond our direct comprehension. This illustrates Kant’s point: our understanding is confined to the realm of phenomena. \\n\\nKant’s insights have profound implications for science and metaphysics, prompting questions about the nature of reality and the limits of scientific inquiry. Three related subjects are the nature of perception, the role of intuition in knowledge, and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. \"",
