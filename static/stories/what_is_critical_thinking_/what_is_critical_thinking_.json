  "clean_story": "Critical thinking. Solving problems. The term 'critical thinking' comes from the Greek word 'kritikos,' meaning to judge or decide. It’s like being a detective, carefully examining clues to solve a mystery. Critical thinking is about asking questions and looking for evidence. Imagine you’re trying to figure out why your plant is dying. Instead of guessing, you check the soil, light, and water—just like a scientist. This way, you can find the real problem and fix it. A great example is how doctors diagnose illnesses. They don’t just guess; they use tests and symptoms to find the cause. This careful approach helps them choose the right treatment. Critical thinking is like having a toolbox of questions to solve any problem. It’s not just about being smart—it’s about being curious and open-minded. Sometimes, the answer isn’t obvious, so you need to think carefully and consider different ideas. This skill helps in school, work, and everyday life. Three related subjects are the science of decision-making, how biases affect our judgments, and the role of logic in solving complex problems.",
