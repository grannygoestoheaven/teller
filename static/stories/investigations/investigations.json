  "clean_story": "Uncovering hidden truths.  Methodical digging for answers. \"Investigation\" comes from the Latin vestigare—to track or follow footprints. It’s like assembling a puzzle where half the pieces are missing, and some might be lies. Most see investigations as dramatic—detectives in trench coats, late-night stakeouts. But the real work is quieter:cross-referencing timestamps, mapping inconsistencies in witness statements, or tracing a single transaction through layers of shell companies. Take the 1972 Watergate break-in. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein didn’t crack the case with a single bombshell. They chipped away—one source (Deep Throat), one financial record, one contradictory quote at a time. Their tool?A notebook, a phone, and the rule: \"Follow the money. \"Or consider forensic accounting. A fraud investigator might spot a CEO’s embezzlement not by a smoking gun, but because his \"business dinners\" always round to $99. 99—just under the $100 receipt threshold requiring approval. Precision matters. The 1993 World Trade Center bombing was solved partly because investigators noticed a Ryder truck’s vehicle identification number (VIN) survived the blast—etched into a fragment. One tiny clue. One thread pulled. Three related subjects are cold case breakthroughs, digital forensics tools, and how bias shapes evidence.",
