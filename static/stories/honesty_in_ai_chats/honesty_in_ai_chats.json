  "clean_story": "\"Truth in code. Trust in answers. \"\n\n\"Honesty in AI chats\" means the system gives facts, admits gaps, and corrects mistakes—like a teacher who says \"I don’t know, but let’s find out. \"<[silence:2400]\n\nMost AI today mimics confidence, even when wrong. A 2023 Stanford study found chatbots invented fake legal cases 6% of the time when pressed for details. Honest AI works differently. It flags uncertainty (\"Records show X, but Y is debated\") and cites sources. For example, if asked \"Does coffee cause cancer?\", it replies: \"WHO classifies it as ‘not carcinogenic,’ but high-temperature brews may pose risks—studies conflict. \"\n\nThe challenge? Users prefer smooth lies over clumsy truth. Google’s 2022 AI principles admitted: \"People trust fluent errors more than hesitant facts. \" Yet honest AI exists. Tools like Perplexity show sources; Wolfram Alpha refuses guesses. Their trade-off? Slower responses, fewer users.\n\nThree related subjects are AI hallucinations, user trust metrics, and transparent algorithm design.",
