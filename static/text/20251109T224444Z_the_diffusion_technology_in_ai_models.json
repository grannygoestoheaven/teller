  "clean": "Noise.  Gradual transformation.  Probability distribution.  Diffusion technology in AI models is a method that involves the gradual transformation of data through a process of adding and removing noise.  This technique is particularly effective in generating high-quality samples from complex data distributions.  By iteratively diffusing noise into data and then reversing the process, AI models can learn to generate new data points that closely resemble the original dataset.  The core of diffusion technology lies in its ability to model the probability distribution of data.  This is achieved by training the model to understand the transition of data from a noise-filled state to a noise-free state.  The process is akin to simulating a reverse diffusion process, where the model learns to predict the data at each step as noise is incrementally removed.  This approach allows for the generation of data with high fidelity and diversity.  Diffusion models have shown significant promise in various applications, including image generation, audio synthesis, and even text creation.  Their ability to handle high-dimensional data makes them particularly suitable for tasks that require generating complex structures.  The iterative nature of diffusion models also allows for fine-grained control over the generation process, offering flexibility in output quality.
