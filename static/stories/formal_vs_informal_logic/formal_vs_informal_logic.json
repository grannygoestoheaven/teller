  "clean_story": "\"Structured rules. Flexible thinking. Formal logic follows strict rules, like a recipe with exact measurements. Informal logic is more like cooking by taste, using intuition and context. Formal logic is precise, like solving a math problem. It uses symbols and defined steps to reach a conclusion. For example, if all A are B, and C is A, then C must be B. This type of logic is used in mathematics and computer programming, where accuracy is crucial. Informal logic, on the other hand, is about understanding and evaluating arguments in everyday language. It’s like figuring out if someone’s reasoning makes sense in a conversation. For instance, if someone says, 'All birds can fly, and penguins are birds, so penguins can fly,' informal logic helps us recognize the flaw in that argument. Both types of logic are important. Formal logic ensures precision in technical fields, while informal logic helps us navigate daily discussions and debates. Understanding both allows us to think critically and communicate effectively. Three related subjects are the history of logic, the role of logic in artificial intelligence, and how logic shapes our understanding of truth. \"",
