    "clean_story": "Persistent connections. Real-time data. Websockets are often overlooked, but their most powerful feature isn’t just speed—it’s how they transform the way applications communicate. Unlike traditional HTTP, which relies on repeated requests and responses, Websockets establish a single, enduring connection between client and server. This allows data to flow instantly in both directions, like a live conversation, without the overhead of reconnecting. A chat message, stock price update, or multiplayer game move can travel near-instantly, reducing latency to milliseconds. This isn’t just efficiency—it’s a paradigm shift for interactive applications. Developers use Websockets to power live notifications, collaborative tools, and even remote-controlled devices, where every millisecond counts. Protocols like Socket.IO, built on Websockets, extend this capability further, adding features like automatic reconnection and fallback support for older browsers. Three related subjects are how real-time communication reshapes user experiences, the challenges of scaling persistent connections, and the future of low-latency technologies in IoT and beyond.",
