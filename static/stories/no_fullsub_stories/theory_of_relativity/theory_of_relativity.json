  "clean_story": "\"Spacetime fabric. Warped reality. Einstein's theory of relativity weaves these concepts together. The term 'relativity' reflects Einstein's insight that space and time aren't absolute, but relative to the observer. Imagine space as a rubber sheet—massive objects curve it, and everything moves along these curves. This is the essence of general relativity. Picture two people: one stationary, one in motion. To the moving person, the stationary one's clock appears to tick slower—a phenomenon known as time dilation. This isn't just theory; it's been proven with precise clocks on airplanes and satellites. Now, consider light. According to special relativity, it always travels at the same speed, regardless of the light source's motion. This leads to another counterintuitive effect: mass increases with speed, making it harder to accelerate objects near light speed. This is why spacecraft need enormous energy to reach high velocities. Three related subjects are how GPS relies on relativity for accurate positioning, the quest to detect gravitational waves predicted by Einstein, and the ongoing search for a unifying theory that combines quantum mechanics and relativity. \"",
