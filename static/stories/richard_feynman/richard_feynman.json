  "clean_story": "\"Physics as play.  Genius without pretense. 'Feynman' sounds like 'fine-man,' but he’d laugh at that—he wore socks with sandals and cracked safes for fun. Richard Feynman didn’t just study physics; he felt it, like a musician hearing equations as melodies. His spark?At 15, he built a radio from scratch—no kit, just scavenged parts and a library book. When MIT’s entrance exam asked to explain how a cat laps milk, he drew the fluid dynamics. They let him in. His toolkit was odd:Bongo drums for rhythm (he claimed they helped his math),—a habit of visualizing electrons as tiny, spinning tops,—and \"Feynman diagrams,\" doodles that turned quantum chaos into simple lines and squiggles. Before him, calculating particle collisions took months. With his diagrams?Hours. During the Manhattan Project, he outsmarted security by memorizing combinations, not codes. Later, he exposed the Challenger disaster’s flaw by dropping an O-ring in ice water—live on TV. No slides. Just a glass of water and a clamp. He called science ‘the belief in the ignorance of experts. ’His lectures weren’t lectures—they were performances,—once demonstrating gravity by juggling plates in a dining hall. Three related subjects are quantum electrodynamics, science as storytelling, and how curiosity outweights credentials. <[silence:1600ms]\"",
