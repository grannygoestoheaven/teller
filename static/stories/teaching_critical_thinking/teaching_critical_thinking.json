  "clean_story": "Questioning assumptions. Sharpening judgment. \"Critical thinking\" means examining ideas carefully instead of accepting them blindly. It’s like testing a bridge before walking across—you check if it’s sturdy, not just because someone says it is. Most people think critical thinking is about being smart or argumentative. But it’s really a set of skills: **asking precise questions, spotting flaws in logic, and weighing evidence fairly**. For example, if a headline claims, *\"Study shows coffee cures diseases!\"* a critical thinker asks: *Who funded the study? How many people were tested? Were other factors considered?* Without these questions, it’s easy to believe misleading claims—like assuming all bridges are safe just because they look sturdy. Teaching it starts with simple exercises. One method is the **\"5 Whys\"**: Keep asking *why* until the real reason surfaces. A child might ask, *\"Why do we recycle?\"* Instead of answering *\"Because it’s good for Earth,\"* you dig deeper: *\"Why is waste bad? Why can’t we keep making new plastic? Why do some materials take 1,000 years to decompose?\"* This trains the brain to seek roots, not just symptoms. Another tool is **contradiction hunting**. Present two opposing views—*\"Some say homework helps learning; others say it causes stress\"*—and ask students to find strengths and weaknesses in both. Research shows this reduces bias. In a 2019 study, students who practiced this were 30% less likely to dismiss opposing arguments outright. Real-world examples make it stick. Analyze ads: *\"Why does this cereal box show smiling kids? Is the product healthy, or just marketed to emotions?\"* Or debate rules: *\"Why do some schools ban phones? What’s the evidence for and against?\"* These aren’t abstract puzzles—they’re daily decisions. The goal isn’t skepticism for its own sake. It’s **discernment**: knowing when to trust, when to doubt, and how to update beliefs with new information. Like a scientist adjusting a hypothesis after new data, not clinging to the first guess. Mistakes are part of the process. Even experts fall for logical traps, like assuming correlation equals causation (*\"Ice cream sales rise with drowning deaths—so does ice cream cause drowning?\"*). The key is catching errors early, like fixing a wobbly bridge before it collapses. Beyond classrooms, critical thinking shapes societies. Laws, medical guidelines, and technologies all rely on rigorous questioning. <[silence:12",
