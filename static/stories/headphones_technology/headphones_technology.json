Electricity as music. \"Headphones\" comes from \"head\" and \"phone\" (Greek for sound), because they sit on your head and turn electrical signals back into the vibrations your brain hears as sound. Most people think of them as just speakers for your ears\u2014but they\u2019re more like tiny translation machines. Inside, a diaphragm\u2014thinner than a human hair\u2014vibrates 20,000 times per second when powered by a song\u2019s electric current. That shaking air becomes the bassline you feelor the whisper of a podcast host. Early models, like Nathaniel Baldwin\u2019s 1910 \"radio earphones,\" used iron filings and magnets wrapped by hand in his kitchen. Today\u2019s planar magnetic drivers\u2014found in high-end headphones\u2014use ultra-thin metal sheets suspended between magnetsto push air with surgical precision. Noise-canceling tech works like a sound vacuum:microphones listen to outside noisethen generate opposite sound waves to erase it\u2014like pressing a dent out of metal. Wireless models now beam audio via Bluetooth\u2014a 1994 invention that turns music into radio pulsesyour headphones catch and decode. Three related subjects are bone conduction audio, how microphones reverse headphones, and why vinyl sounds warmer.", "timestamp": "20260301T095606Z"}
