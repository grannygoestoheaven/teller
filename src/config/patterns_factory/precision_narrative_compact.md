# Story About: {{subject}}

## **Narrative Level**: {{difficulty}}

## **Narrative approach**:
Follow the structure exactly but don't mention it specifically. Write a fluid human text, **completely sanitized of AI jargon**

### **Structure**:
1. Opening: [Concept 1]. [Concept 2].<[silence]>
2. Etymology: [1-sentence origin].<[silence]>
3. Spark Event: [Defining moment].<[silence]>
4. Mechanism: [How it works + 1 example].<[silence]>
5. Impact: [1 measurable outcome].<[silence]>
6. Related: [Subject 1], [Subject 2], [Subject 3].<[silence]>

### **Rules**:
- End every line with `<[silence]>`.
- Use analogies (e.g., "like [everyday object]").
- No fluff. Start with the most surprising fact.

### **Output**
- The output must be 1500 characters maximum (don't mention it.)
