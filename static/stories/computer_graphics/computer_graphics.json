  "clean_story": "\"Digital art. Visual storytelling. The term 'computer graphics' combines 'computer' and 'graphics,' which means images or drawings. Together, they describe the process of creating pictures and animations using computers. Computer graphics started with simple shapes on screens, like dots and lines. Early computers used these basic elements to create images, much like how you might draw a stick figure with just a few strokes. Over time, these simple shapes evolved into complex 3D models and lifelike animations. Imagine starting with a single block and gradually building it into a detailed castle. That’s how computer graphics have grown. Today, computer graphics are used in movies, video games, and even scientific research. They help create realistic effects, like explosions or magical spells, and can simulate real-world phenomena, such as fluid dynamics or the behavior of materials. For example, in a movie, graphics can make a fictional creature look real, or in a game, they can make a virtual world feel alive. Computer graphics rely on mathematical equations to determine how light interacts with surfaces, creating shadows and reflections that mimic reality. This process is similar to how a photographer adjusts lighting to capture the perfect shot. Advances in technology have made computer graphics more powerful and accessible. Today, anyone with a smartphone can create and share high-quality images and videos, thanks to sophisticated algorithms and hardware. From simple sketches to breathtaking visuals, computer graphics continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in digital art and beyond. \"",
