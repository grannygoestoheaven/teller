  "clean_story": "Rebel with a cause.  Hollywood’s lost lightning. \"James Dean\" wasn’t just a name—it became shorthand for the restless, the misunderstood, the ones who burned too fast. Most remember the leather jacket, the slouch, the smoldering stare in Rebel Without a Cause—but that was just the spark. The fire started earlier, in a Indiana farmhouse, where a quiet kid raised by an aunt after his mother’s death buried his grief in acting. By 1951, he was in New York, sleeping on couches, studying method acting under Lee Strasberg—not to perform, but to survive. Dean didn’t act rebellion. He was it. On set, he’d improvise lines, ignore marks, even speed through dialogue to unnerve co-stars—like in East of Eden, where his frantic pacing mirrored his character’s desperation. Directors hated it. Audiences couldn’t look away. His tools?A 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder (nicknamed \"Little Bastard\"), a love of bullfighting, and a notebook where he scribbled poems about loneliness. He’d race cars at 100 mph between takes, as if chasing something just out of reach. Then—September 30, 1955. A head-on collision near Cholame, California. The car folded like paper. He was 24. Three films released. One Oscar nomination (posthumous). Zero chances to outgrow the myth. Three related subjects are method acting extremes, 1950s teen alienation, and cars as cultural symbols.",
