  "clean_story": "Shared words. Shifting sounds. Globalization means the world’s languages mixing—like ingredients in a shared pot. The name fits: it’s about things (ideas, goods, words) spreading across globes—Earth’s borders. --- Most see globalization as trade or travel. But its quietest tool is language. When people connect, words hitch rides—borrowed, bent, or born anew. English now dominates science and business. Not because it’s \"better,\" but because the British Empire (then the U. S.) spread it like a default setting. Today, 1. 5 billion people speak it—only 360 million as a first language. The rest? A tool, like a wrench or a web browser. Yet languages don’t just submit. They adapt. French took \"le weekend\" from English. Japanese turned \"pan\" (from Portuguese pão) into their word for bread. Arabic scripts now spell \"internet\" as إنترنت—same sounds, new symbols. Some words travel faster. \"Coffee\" started in Arabic (qahwa), jumped to Turkish (kahve), then Italian (caffè), before English sipped it up. \"Ketchup\" began as Chinese kê-tsiap—a fish sauce—before tomatoes and sugar reshaped it in the West. But globalization doesn’t just add words. It subtracts. Every 3 months, a language dies. Like Aka-Bea in India (last speaker: 2010) or Eyak in Alaska (2008). When a language vanishes, so do unique ideas—like Tuvan’s throat singing terms or Inuit’s 50 words for snow. Tech speeds this up. Google Translate handles 133 languages—but favors widely spoken ones. AI chatbots default to English, Spanish, or Mandarin. The internet’s top 10 languages cover 82% of users. The other 7, 000+? Fighting for screen space. Yet resistance hides in plain sight. Welsh schools teach through Cymraeg. Hawaiian, once banned in schools, now labels street signs. Maori tattoos (tā moko) tell stories skin-deep, untranslated. Globalization’s language game isn’t just about winning. It’s about blending—like tea steeped in foreign water. Some flavors dominate.
