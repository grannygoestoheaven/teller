  "clean_story": "\"Water from air. Shade from nothing. \"\n\n\"Desert survival tricks\" means using the land’s hidden tools to stay alive where resources seem invisible.\n\n\nDeserts look empty, but they’re full of secrets. A cactus isn’t just a plant—it’s a water tank. Cut a barrel cactus at dawn, scoop the pulp, and squeeze: one liter per plant. Too bitter? Boil it with charcoal to filter the taste.\n\nNo cactus? Dig a solar still. A hole one meter deep, a cup in the center, cover with plastic, place a rock in the middle. By noon, condensation drips into the cup—300 milliliters a day. Like wringing water from the sky.\n\nHeat kills faster than thirst. A trench two feet deep, covered with a blanket, drops the temperature by 15°C. Lie inside before midday. Or walk at night, using stars for direction—Orion’s belt points north in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nFire without matches? A battery and gum wrapper work. Touch the foil’s edges to the battery’s terminals—it ignites in seconds. Or rub a hardwood stick between your palms on a softwood base. Smoke first, then flame.\n\nThree related subjects are edible desert plants, sandstorm shelter tactics, and animal-track water finding.",
