  "clean_story": "Whispers without sound.  Signals hidden in plain sight. \"Silent communication\" describes how animals exchange messages using no vocal noise—just body language, scents, or invisible cues. Like a text message sent with only emojis and timing. Bees perform the waggle dance—a figure-eight loop that encodes direction and distance to flowers. Each second of buzzing equals 750 meters farther. Ants lay pheromone trails, evaporating after hours to avoid outdated routes. Elephants detect infrasound vibrations through their feet, sensing storms 100 miles away. Octopuses change skin texture to mimic coral or sand, fooling predators without moving. Even plants \"scream\" via ultrasonic clicks when dehydrated—though humans can’t hear it. Three related subjects are chemical signaling tricks, vibration-based hunting, and how silence shapes ecosystems.",
