  "clean_story": "Paradoxes. Riddles of thought. The word 'paradox' comes from Greek, meaning 'contrary to expectation. ' Paradoxes are statements or situations that seem impossible or contradictory at first glance, but they often reveal deeper truths. Think of them like optical illusions for the mind. They challenge our usual ways of thinking and force us to look at things differently. One famous paradox is the 'Liar Paradox,' where a statement says, 'This sentence is false. ' If the sentence is true, then it must be false, and if it’s false, then it must be true. It’s like a loop that can’t be resolved. Another example is the 'Ship of Theseus,' which asks: If you replace every part of a ship over time, is it still the same ship? It makes us question what truly defines identity. Paradoxes aren’t just puzzles—they’ve shaped philosophy, science, and even technology. They’ve helped us understand concepts like infinity, time, and consciousness. Three related subjects are the nature of truth, the limits of human reasoning, and how paradoxes influence modern science.",
