  "clean_story": "\"Dust walls. Survival math. \"\n\"Sandstorm shelter tactics\" means outsmarting a storm’s fury with speed and cover.\n\nSandstorms don’t announce themselves—they erupt. Winds hit 50 mph, hurling sand like tiny bullets. Your move? Drop, cover, seal.\n\nFirst, find low ground. A ditch, a dry riverbed—anywhere wind flows over you, not through you. Like hiding under a table during an earthquake.\nNext, cover your air. A scarf, shirt, or even your hands over nose/mouth—breathing sand burns lungs. Think of it as filtering coffee grounds from your drink.\nIf trapped in a vehicle, park, turn off AC, and seal vents. Engines suck in sand like vacuums, ruining filters. Wait it out.\n\nBedouins use tight-woven cloth to block sand while letting air pass. Modern preppers pack N95 masks + goggles—same idea, lab-tested.\n\nThree related subjects are desert navigation tricks, improvised air filters, and flash flood escapes.",
