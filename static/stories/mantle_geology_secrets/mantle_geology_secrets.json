  "clean_story": "Earth’s hidden engine. Molten rock, shifting plates.\n\n\nThe word mantle comes from the Latin mantellum—a cloak. It wraps around Earth’s core like a thick, slow-moving blanket. <[silence:2400ms]\n\nMost think of it as static. But it’s alive—creeping at the speed fingernails grow.\n\nDeep tremors reveal its secrets. Seismic waves bend where rock melts into magma. Like light through a warped lens.\n\nDiamond inclusions trap ancient minerals. Some hold water—proof oceans leak downward for billions of years.\n\nOne mystery: \"ultra-low velocity zones. \" Blobs near the core where waves crawl. Maybe iron puddles. Maybe Earth’s first crust, sunk and dissolved.\n\nThree related subjects are plate tectonics origins, volcanic hotspot tracks, and how planets cool over time.",
