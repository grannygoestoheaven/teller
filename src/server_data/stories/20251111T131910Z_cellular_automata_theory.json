  "clean": "Rule 30.  Self-replication.  Emergent behavior.  Cellular automata theory explores how simple, discrete models can simulate complex systems.  A cellular automaton consists of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states.  The state of each cell updates based on a set of rules that consider the states of neighboring cells.  This process unfolds over discrete time steps, revealing intricate patterns and behaviors.  Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton that demonstrates how simple rules can generate randomness.  Despite its simplicity, Rule 30 produces patterns that appear chaotic and unpredictable.  This has implications for fields like cryptography, where unpredictability is valuable.  Rule 30 exemplifies the potential of cellular automata to model complex phenomena.  Self-replication is another intriguing aspect of cellular automata.  John von Neumann's work in the 1940s introduced the concept of a self-replicating automaton, laying groundwork for artificial life studies.  These automata can duplicate their structure, offering insights into biological processes.  The study of self-replication in cellular automata continues to influence research in computational biology.  Emergent behavior in cellular automata arises when simple rules lead to unexpected, complex patterns.  This behavior is significant in understanding how local interactions can produce global order.  Cellular automata serve as a framework for exploring emergent phenomena in natural and artificial systems.  They provide a lens through which researchers can examine the dynamics of complex systems.  Three related subjects are complexity theory, artificial life, and computational biology.",
