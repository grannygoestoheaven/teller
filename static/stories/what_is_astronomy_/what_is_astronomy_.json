  "clean_story": "Astronomy. The study of the universe. The word 'astronomy' comes from Greek, meaning 'star law. ' It’s like being a cosmic detective, using math and physics to uncover the secrets of stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomy isn’t just about stargazing. It’s about understanding how the universe works, from the birth of stars to the mysteries of black holes. Imagine you’re solving a puzzle where each piece is a planet, a galaxy, or a distant star. Astronomers use telescopes to collect light from these objects, like reading messages from billions of years ago. One of the coolest tools in astronomy is the Hubble Space Telescope. Orbiting Earth since 1990, it has captured stunning images of nebulae, galaxies, and even distant planets. These images help scientists understand how stars and galaxies form and evolve. For example, Hubble’s images of the Pillars of Creation show where new stars are born, like a cosmic nursery. Astronomy also helps us understand our own planet. By studying other worlds, we learn about Earth’s past, present, and future. For instance, finding water on Mars suggests that life might exist—or have existed—elsewhere in the universe. This makes astronomy not just about the stars, but also about our place in the cosmos. Three related subjects are the search for extraterrestrial life, the mysteries of dark matter, and how telescopes are changing our view of the universe.",
