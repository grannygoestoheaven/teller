    "clean_story": "Bioelectric fields. Natural detection. Sharks are legendary predators, but their most extraordinary ability isn’t their teeth or speed—it’s how they find prey they can’t see or smell. Beneath their skin, tiny gel-filled pores called ampullae of Lorenzini detect the faint electrical fields generated by every living creature. A fish hiding under sand still gives itself away with each breath, each muscle twitch, sending electrical ripples through the water. Sharks sense these signals, picking up voltage changes as small as a few billionths of a volt per centimeter. This isn’t just hunting—it’s electroreception, a sense so precise it lets them strike in complete darkness or murky water where other predators would fail. Even newborn sharks rely on it from their first hunt, their bodies tuned to read the ocean’s invisible signals. Great whites and hammerheads, for example, may use this same sense to navigate magnetic highways during migrations across entire ocean basins. Three related subjects are how animals perceive hidden forces, the adaptations that define deep-sea survival, and the ways shark biology inspires technology.",
