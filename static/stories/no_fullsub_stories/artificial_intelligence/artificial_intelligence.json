  "clean_story": "\"Artificial Intelligence. Cognitive automation. The term 'artificial intelligence' combines 'artificial' and 'intelligence,' reflecting its goal to mimic human thought processes. While AI is often associated with futuristic robots, its roots lie in a 1956 conference where John McCarthy coined the term to describe machines that could learn and problem-solve. Today, AI is woven into our daily lives, from predictive text on phones to Netflix recommendations. At its core, AI relies on machine learning algorithms that improve performance through experience, much like how a child learns to recognize cats after seeing many pictures. These algorithms, like neural networks, are designed to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. For instance, a self-driving car uses AI to 'see' and react to its environment, processing millions of data points per second to navigate safely. However, AI isn't perfect. It can struggle with ambiguity and bias, issues highlighted by the 'AI art' controversy where a piece sold for $432,500, raising questions about AI's creative capabilities and the value of human input. Moreover, AI's energy demands are immense, with some models consuming as much power as a small town, sparking debates about sustainability.
