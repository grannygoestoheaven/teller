In 1987, scientists discovered OLEDs could create bright, colorful light using organic materials. OLEDs work like tiny light bulbs made of special carbon-based materials. When electricity passes through, they glow brightly, like turning on a flashlight instead of lighting a candle. OLED screens use less power and show more vibrant colors than older screens.
