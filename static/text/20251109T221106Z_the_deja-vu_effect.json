  "clean": "Memory anomaly, temporal lobe, cognitive processing, familiarity, neurological phenomena.\n\n The déjà-vu effect is an intriguing cognitive phenomenon where an individual experiences a strong sensation that an event or situation currently being encountered has been experienced in the past.  This sensation, while fleeting, is often accompanied by a feeling of familiarity and recognition, despite the knowledge that the specific situation is novel.  Neurologically, déjà-vu is associated with the temporal lobe of the brain, particularly the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory formation and retrieval.   Research suggests that déjà-vu may result from a misfiring of neurons in the brain, leading to a temporary overlap between short-term and long-term memory circuits.  This misalignment can create a false sense of familiarity, as the brain mistakenly interprets the current experience as a past memory.  While the exact mechanisms remain under investigation, studies have shown that déjà-vu is more commonly reported by individuals with epilepsy, particularly those with temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting a neurological basis for the phenomenon.   Interestingly, déjà-vu is not solely a neurological occurrence but also involves cognitive processing.  Some theories propose that déjà-vu may arise from a delay in the brain's processing of sensory information, leading to a brief overlap between perception and memory.  This delay can result in the sensation of having already experienced the present moment.  Despite its prevalence, déjà-vu remains a topic of fascination and study, as it challenges our understanding of memory and perception.   Three related subjects are the Mandela Effect, the phenomenon of jamais vu, and the study of memory consolidation.",
