  "clean": "Energy landscapes.  Associative memory.  Stability.  The Hopfield Network, introduced by John Hopfield in 1982, is a form of recurrent artificial neural network.  It is designed to serve as a content-addressable memory system, or associative memory, with binary threshold nodes.  This network is characterized by its energy function, which is used to determine the stability of the system.  Each state of the network corresponds to a point in the energy landscape, and the network evolves to minimize its energy, settling into stable states that represent stored memories.  A distinctive feature of the Hopfield Network is its symmetric weight matrix, which ensures that the energy function is well-defined.  This symmetry leads to convergence to a stable state, making the network robust against noise and partial input data.  The network can retrieve stored patterns from incomplete or noisy inputs, demonstrating its associative memory capabilities.  However, the capacity of the network is limited, typically storing only about 0. 15 times the number of neurons as stable patterns.  Despite its limitations, the Hopfield Network has paved the way for more advanced models in neural computation.  Its simplicity and clear theoretical foundation make it an important model in understanding the dynamics of neural networks.  The network's ability to model associative memory has influenced the development of other models, such as Boltzmann Machines and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.  Three related subjects are Boltzmann Machines, neural computation, and associative memory systems.",
