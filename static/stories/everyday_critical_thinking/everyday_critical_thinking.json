  "clean_story": "**Everyday critical thinking. Solving problems smarter. **\nThe term 'critical thinking' comes from the Greek word 'kritikos,' meaning to judge or decide. It’s like being a detective, always asking questions and looking for clues to solve mysteries in daily life. Critical thinking is about making better decisions by questioning assumptions and evaluating information. Imagine you’re trying to choose the best snack from a vending machine. Instead of just picking the first colorful option, you think: *What’s healthy? What’s my budget?* This process helps you make a smarter choice. One way to practice critical thinking is by asking questions like *Why?* and *How?* For example, if your phone battery drains quickly, you might ask: *Why is this happening?* Then, you test possible answers: *Is an app using too much power? Is the battery old?* This method helps you find the real problem and fix it. Another tool is comparing information from different sources. If you’re researching a topic, you don’t rely on just one website. You check multiple sources to see if they agree or disagree, just like getting advice from different friends before making a big decision. This helps you avoid mistakes and find the most reliable answer. Critical thinking also means recognizing biases—prejudices that affect how we see things. For example, if you only watch news from one channel, you might miss important facts. By seeking out different viewpoints, you get a clearer picture, like putting together pieces of a puzzle. This helps you make fairer and more informed choices. In everyday life, critical thinking helps with everything from choosing a movie to planning a trip. It’s about being curious, asking questions, and using logic to make the best decisions. By practicing these skills, you become better at solving problems and making choices that work for you.",
