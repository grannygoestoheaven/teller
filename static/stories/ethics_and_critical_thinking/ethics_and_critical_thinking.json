  "clean_story": "**Questioning choices. Weighing consequences. 'Ethics' comes from the Greek *ethos*, meaning 'character' or 'custom. ' It’s the study of what’s right and wrong, like an invisible rulebook for decisions. 'Critical thinking' is the tool to test those rules—breaking down arguments, spotting flaws, and asking, *Why?* Ethics without critical thinking is like a compass without a map. You might know ‘north’ is good, but not *why* it’s the right direction or how to get there. For example, lying is often called unethical. But critical thinking asks: *What if lying saves a life?* During World War II, Dutch families hid Jews from Nazis. When soldiers knocked, asking, *Are there Jews here?* the ethical choice—*protect life*—clashed with the rule *don’t lie*. Critical thinking exposed the conflict: rigid rules sometimes fail real-world tests. Ethics provides the *goals* (fairness, honesty, kindness), while critical thinking supplies the *method*. Imagine a doctor with one dose of medicine and two patients. Ethics says, *Save lives. * Critical thinking asks: *Who needs it more? Who decided? What if both die without it?* Without this pairing, ethics becomes slogans (*Be kind!*), and critical thinking becomes cold logic (*Who cares?*). The test of both? **Discomfort. ** Ethical dilemmas force you to pick between bad options. Critical thinking demands you defend your choice with evidence, not just feeling. A classic example: the *trolley problem*. A runaway trolley will kill five people unless you pull a lever to divert it, killing one. Ethics screams, *Don’t kill!* Critical thinking replies: *Then five die. Is inaction a choice?* There’s no ‘right’ answer—only the work of thinking through it. This combo shows up in everyday life. Should you buy cheap clothes made in sweatshops? Ethics nudges, *Avoid harm. * Critical thinking digs: *How much more does ‘ethical’ clothing cost? Who can afford it? Does boycotting help workers or hurt them?* The goal isn’t perfection—it’s *aware* choices. Bias is the enemy of both. Humans favor information that matches their beliefs, a trick called *confirmation bias*. Ethics demands fairness; critical thinking.",
