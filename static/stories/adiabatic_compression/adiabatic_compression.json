    "clean": "Extreme pressure. Sudden cold. Adiabatic compression is the unseen force governing how gases respond when confined—revealing energy through sheer constraint, not external heat. This phenomenon drives systems where temperature shifts are not just expected but exploited. \n\nIn diesel engines, air is compressed to 1/20th its volume, reaching temperatures exceeding 500°C—hot enough to ignite fuel without a spark. The process isn’t about adding heat; it’s about removing space. The same principle explains why aerosol cans ice over when sprayed: rapid expansion steals heat from the surroundings, leaving frost in its wake. The relationship is absolute, dictated by **PV^γ = constant**, where γ, the heat capacity ratio, determines how drastically temperature responds to changes in pressure or volume. \n\nAdiabatic compression isn’t just a mechanical quirk. It’s a fundamental rule of thermodynamics, shaping everything from industrial machinery to weather patterns. In refrigeration, compressors rely on this principle to manipulate heat, while in nature, adiabatic cooling contributes to cloud formation as warm air rises and expands. The efficiency of these processes hinges on managing γ, a value that varies with the gas and defines the system’s limits. \n\nThree related subjects are the role of adiabatic processes in climate modeling, the engineering challenges of thermal management in high-pressure systems, and the theoretical boundaries imposed by the Carnot Cycle on energy conversion.",
