The name 'Neo-Tokyo' means 'New Tokyo,' showing it's a rebuilt version of the city after a disaster. \\n\\nPeople often think of Neo-Tokyo as a place full of bright lights and advanced technology, but it also has a darker side with crowded streets and hidden dangers. The city is designed with towering skyscrapers and glowing signs, making it look like a mix of a bustling metropolis and a sci-fi dream. Imagine walking through a city where every corner is lit up like a festival, but there are also shadows where secrets hide. \\n\\nIn 'Akira,' Neo-Tokyo is not just a backdrop; it’s a character itself.

The creators used real-world Tokyo as inspiration, adding futuristic elements to show what a city might look like if technology kept advancing rapidly. \\n\\nNeo-Tokyo’s unique style has influenced many other movies and games, making it a symbol of cyberpunk culture. It’s a place where the future feels both amazing and a little bit scary, like a rollercoaster ride you can’t resist. \\n\\nThree related subjects are cyberpunk design, urban futures, and the impact of technology on cities. \"",
