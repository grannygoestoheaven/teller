  "clean_story": "Choices without choosing. AI’s \"what if\" engine. \"Simulating alternatives\" means AI tests many possible paths—like a chess player imagining 50 moves ahead, but for any decision. Most people assume AI picks one answer. In reality, it often builds a hidden map of options first. Here’s how:An AI predicting traffic doesn’t just say \"10-minute delay. \"It runs thousands of virtual scenarios—accidents here,road closures there,sudden rain—then averages the outcomes. Tools like Monte Carlo Tree Search (used in AlphaGo) or counterfactual simulations (for medical diagnoses) turn uncertainty into probabilities. Example:A hospital AI might ask, \"What if this patient skipped their meds yesterday?\"—then adjusts treatment plans based on simulated risks. The key?AI doesn’t guess—it stress-tests reality by inventing versions of it. Three related subjects are decision trees in code, how humans imagine futures, and quantum parallel universes.",
