  "clean_story": "Quantum coherence.  Error correction.  C12 technology in quantum computing is an innovative approach that leverages carbon-12 isotopes to enhance quantum coherence times.  Quantum coherence refers to the ability of a quantum system to maintain its state over time without degradation.  By utilizing carbon-12, which lacks nuclear spin, the interference from unwanted magnetic fields is minimized.  This reduction in interference allows qubits to remain coherent for longer periods, thereby improving the reliability of quantum computations.  Error correction is another significant aspect of C12 technology.  Quantum systems are inherently prone to errors due to their sensitivity to external disturbances.  C12 technology aids in reducing these errors by providing a more stable environment for qubits.  This stability is achieved through the reduction of decoherence, which is the loss of quantum information to the environment.  As a result, error rates are lowered, making quantum computations more accurate and efficient.  The integration of C12 technology into quantum computing systems also impacts scalability.  Scalability is the ability to increase the number of qubits without a proportional increase in error rates.  By maintaining coherence and reducing errors, C12 technology facilitates the development of larger quantum systems.  This advancement is vital for the practical application of quantum computing in solving complex problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers.  Three related subjects are quantum entanglement, superconducting qubits, and quantum algorithms.",
