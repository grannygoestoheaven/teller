  "clean_story": "A brain hiccup. Memory’s false echo. \"Déjà vu\" means \"already seen\" in French—because your brain tricks you into thinking this moment is a replay. It’s like flipping through a photo album and swearing you’ve lived a snapshot before—except the photo doesn’t exist. Here’s the glitch:Your brain processes sights, sounds, and decisions in fractions of a second. Sometimes, the \"save file\" (your short-term memory) gets written twice—like a computer buffering the same frame. The second write lags by 10–30 milliseconds. Too fast to notice consciously, but your brain’s comparison system flags it as \"familiar. \"Example:You walk into a room. —Your eyes send the scene to your hippocampus (memory center). —A neuron misfires, duplicating the signal. —Your brain thinks, \"Wait, I’ve ‘loaded’ this before. \"No ghostly past life. Just a timing error in your neural Wi-Fi. Lab tests show déjà vu spikes when people are tired or stressed—like an overworked router dropping packets. Three related subjects are false memory experiments, how sleep deprivation warps perception, and why glitches feel ‘meaningful’.",
