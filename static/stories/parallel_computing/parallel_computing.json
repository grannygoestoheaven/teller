  "clean_story": "\"Speeding up tasks. Solving big problems. The term 'parallel computing' comes from 'parallel,' meaning things happening at the same time. It’s like having a team of workers tackling different parts of a project together instead of one person doing everything alone. Parallel computing is used when a problem is too big or complex for a single computer to handle quickly. Imagine you’re baking a cake, but instead of doing each step one by one—mixing, preheating, decorating—you and your friends divide the tasks. You mix the batter, someone else preheats the oven, and another person prepares the frosting. This way, the cake is ready much faster. A real-world example is weather forecasting. Weather models involve massive amounts of data, like temperature, wind speed, and air pressure from all over the world. Instead of one computer calculating everything, parallel computing splits the work across many computers. Each computer handles a different region or type of data, and then they combine their results to create an accurate forecast. This is how meteorologists can predict storms or heatwaves days in advance. Parallel computing isn’t just about speed, though. <[silance]> It also makes it possible to solve problems that would be impossible for a single computer. For example, scientists use it to simulate how proteins fold, which helps in designing new medicines. Without parallel computing, these simulations would take years instead of hours. Of course, parallel computing has its challenges. Coordinating many computers to work together requires careful planning, like making sure all the workers in our cake-baking example are on the same page. But the benefits far outweigh the difficulties, especially in fields like artificial intelligence, where training a single AI model can require more computing.",
