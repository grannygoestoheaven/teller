  "clean_story": "Memory replay.  Sleep’s hidden workshop.\n\nThe phrase \"sleep reshapes memories\" comes from how the brain reactivates and reorganizes daily experiences while you rest—like a librarian sorting books overnight, but faster and without hands.\n\nMost think sleep is just downtime. But inside, your brain runs a silent replay. Neurons fire in the same patterns as when you learned something new— like practicing piano scales in your sleep, but for facts, skills, even emotions.\n\nTake rats in a maze. While awake, their brain cells light up in sequence as they navigate. During sleep, those same sequences repeat— up to 20 times faster. It’s not random. The hippocampus, your brain’s recorder, sends clips to the cortex, the long-term storage. Weak connections fade. Strong ones sharpen.\n\nHumans do this too. Learn a dance move before bed? Your sleeping brain replays it, locking it in. Skip sleep? Those moves stay clumsy. Studies show even a 90-minute nap boosts memory retention by 20%.\n\nSleep doesn’t just store memories— it edits them. Emotional edges soften. Useful details stick. Irrelevant ones drop. Like a director cutting a film for clarity.\n\nThree related subjects are memory consolidation,  how dreams distort recall,  and why naps outperform cramming.",
