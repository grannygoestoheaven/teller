  "clean_story": "Language study. Tracing words through time. The word *linguistics* comes from Latin *lingua*, meaning \"tongue\" or \"language\"—because early thinkers saw speech as the core of human communication. Long before textbooks, people noticed languages changed. Around 500 BCE, Indian grammarian **Pāṇini** wrote 4,000 rules to describe Sanskrit, like a manual for how words bend and combine. His work was so precise, it’s still used today—like a 2,500-year-old instruction book that never went out of print. In Europe, the study of language stayed quiet until the 18th century, when scholars compared Sanskrit to Greek and Latin. They realized these languages shared roots, like branches of the same tree. This discovery birthed **historical linguistics**, the idea that languages evolve from older forms—just as modern French grew from Latin. By the 1900s, linguists shifted focus to **how language works now**, not just its past. **Ferdinand de Saussure** split language into *langue* (the system, like grammar rules) and *parole* (how people actually speak). Think of *langue* as a board game’s rulebook, and *parole* as the messy, creative ways players bend those rules. Then came **Noam Chomsky** in the 1950s, arguing humans are born with a \"language instinct\"—a mental toolkit for grammar. He compared it to how birds instinctively build nests: no one teaches them, but they *know* how. His idea sparked debates: *Is language learned or hardwired?* Today, linguistics spans **brain scans** (how words light up neural paths), **AI** (teaching computers to parse sentences), and **dying languages** (racing to record the 3,000+ tongues at risk of vanishing). Language isn’t just words—it’s a living record of who we are, how we think, and the invisible threads tying past to present. Lost languages. Childhood acquisition. Machines that translate.",
