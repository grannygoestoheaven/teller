  "clean_story": "First words. Brain wiring. The term *language acquisition* describes how humans absorb language naturally, like a sponge soaking up water, without formal lessons. Babies don’t study grammar charts, yet by age 5, most can speak fluently. Their brains detect patterns in sounds—repeated words, tones, rhythms—like cracking a code. A newborn recognizes their mother’s voice within days. By 6 months, they distinguish sounds of their native language from foreign ones. By 12 months, they link words to objects: *\"ball\"* means the round thing they toss. This isn’t just memorization. A child hearing *\"I walked\"* and *\"She walks\"* unconsciously deduces rules for past tense, even overapplying them (*\"I goed\"*). Errors reveal learning in action. Adults correct less than you’d think—kids self-correct by comparing their speech to others’, like tuning an instrument by ear. Critical periods exist. Before puberty, the brain’s plasticity makes language absorption effortless. After, it’s harder but not impossible—like learning to ride a bike as a teen versus a toddler. Bilingual kids switch languages mid-sentence without confusion, proving the brain treats languages as tools, not separate boxes. Environment shapes speed. Children in talkative households hear 30 million more words by age 3 than those in quiet ones. But quality matters more than quantity: back-and-forth conversations accelerate learning 6x faster than passive TV exposure. Animals offer clues. Songbirds learn melodies from adults, much like human babies mimic speech. When isolated, both species develop broken, simplified versions—proof that interaction is key. The stakes are high. Delayed language links to literacy struggles, but early intervention (like sign language for deaf infants) can rewrite outcomes. The brain’s hunger for language is so strong that feral children, like Genie (locked in silence until age 13), never fully recover grammar skills. Neural maps light up during acquisition. fMRI scans show Broca’s area (speech production) and Wernicke’s area (comprehension) firing in sync as toddlers babble. By age 2, these regions specialize, like workers taking permanent jobs. Yet mysteries remain. Why do some kids master multiple languages while others struggle with one? How does the brain store 50,000+ words without a filing system? And why does music—another pattern.",
