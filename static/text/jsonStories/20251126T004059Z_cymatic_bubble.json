  "clean": "Resonant frequencies.  Fluid dynamics.  Acoustic patterns.  Cymatic Bubble is a phenomenon where sound waves interact with a liquid medium to create visible patterns on the surface of a bubble.  This interaction is governed by the principles of cymatics, a field dedicated to the study of sound wave phenomena.  When sound frequencies are applied to a liquid, they cause vibrations that result in intricate geometric shapes.  These shapes are not random but are determined by the frequency and amplitude of the sound waves.  The formation of cymatic patterns on bubbles is a result of the interplay between sound waves and surface tension.  As sound waves pass through the liquid, they create standing waves that alter the bubble's surface.  The surface tension of the bubble acts as a canvas, allowing the sound waves to paint complex patterns that are both symmetrical and dynamic.  This process is influenced by various factors, including the viscosity of the liquid and the frequency of the sound.  Research into Cymatic Bubbles offers insights into the broader implications of sound wave interactions with matter.  By studying these patterns, scientists can better understand the principles of wave mechanics and their applications in fields such as acoustics and fluid dynamics.  Innovations in this area may lead to advancements in material science, where sound waves could be used to manipulate the properties of substances at a microscopic level.  The study of cymatic patterns also has potential applications in art and design, providing a unique method for visualizing sound.  Three related subjects are the physics of sound waves, the study of fluid dynamics, and the applications of cymatics in art and design.",
