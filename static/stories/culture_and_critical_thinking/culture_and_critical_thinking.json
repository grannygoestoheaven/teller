  "clean_story": "Shared beliefs. Questioning them.\n\n\"Culture\" comes from the Latin colere—to tend, to care for. Like a garden, it’s what a group grows together: language, food, holidays, even how they argue.\nCritical thinking is the tool that prunes that garden. It asks: Why do we celebrate this way? Who benefits from this rule? What if we’re wrong?\n\nImagine a fish asking, \"Why do we only swim in circles?\" The other fish might say, \"Because we always have!\" Critical thinking is the fish that swims outward—to test the current, to map the reef.\nCultures rely on unspoken rules, like how Americans tip waitstaff or how Japanese trains run silent. But rules aren’t laws of physics. In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat—a cultural rule, not a natural one. Her act forced a question: Who decided this rule, and why?\n\nCritical thinking doesn’t destroy culture. It reveals it. Like X-rays showing bones beneath skin, it exposes the framework so we can choose: keep, adjust, or discard.\nA chef tweaks a recipe. A programmer debugs code. A society? It examines its traditions.\nThe goal isn’t rebellion—it’s awareness.\n\nCognitive biases.\nGroupthink experiments.\nHow languages shape thought.",
