  "clean_story": "**Scattered focus. Bursts of energy.**\nADHD stands for *Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder*—but the name is misleading. It’s not about lacking attention; it’s about **controlling** it, like a radio stuck between stations, picking up everything at once instead of tuning into one.\n\nMost people think of ADHD as kids bouncing off walls or daydreaming in class. But the real challenge is **invisible**: a brain that races ahead while the body struggles to keep up, or gets stuck on small details like a needle skipping on a record. Tasks that feel simple to others—sitting still, following steps, remembering a to-do list—can require **Herculean effort**, not because of laziness, but because the brain’s \"brakes\" and \"gas pedal\" work differently.\n\nHere’s how it plays out:\n- **Hyperfocus**: Ever gotten so absorbed in a video game or hobby that hours vanish? That’s ADHD’s superpower—and curse. The brain locks onto something fascinating but can’t switch off, even for meals or sleep.\n- **Time blindness**: Minutes and hours feel the same, like a clock with no hands. Deadlines sneak up, or tasks take twice as long because distractions derail progress.\n- **Emotional intensity**: Frustration, excitement, or boredom hit **hard and fast**, like a storm rolling in without warning.\n\nThe difference isn’t behavior—it’s **brain wiring**. Studies show ADHD brains often have lower dopamine (a chemical that helps with motivation and focus), so they seek stimulation just to feel \"normal.\" That’s why fidgeting, risk-taking, or constant movement can help some people concentrate.\n\nTools like timers, body doubling (working alongside someone else), or breaking tasks into tiny steps can help—but there’s no one-size-fits-all fix. Medication (like stimulants) can act like \"glasses for the brain,\" sharpening focus for some, while therapy teaches coping strategies.\n\nWhat’s often missed? ADHD isn’t just a childhood phase. **60% of kids with ADHD still have it as adults**, though it might look like chronic lateness, forgotten appointments, or a desk buried in half-finished projects. Some of history’s most creative minds—like Leonardo da Vinci or Simone Biles—had traits that align with ADHD, proving that what’s often called a \"disorder\" can also be a **different way of thinking**.\n\nThe bigger questions lurk beneath: How does society design schools, workplaces, or even conversations for brains that don’t fit the \"standard\" mold? What if distraction isn’t a flaw, but a feature of a mind built for exploration? And why do we pathologize traits that, in the right setting, become strengths?",
