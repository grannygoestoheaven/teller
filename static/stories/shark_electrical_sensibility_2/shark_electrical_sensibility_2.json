    "clean_story": "Electroreception. Ampullae of Lorenzini. Hidden prey. Earth’s magnetic field. These aren’t just sensory tools—they’re the reason sharks hunt with unseen precision. The ampullae of Lorenzini, gel-filled pores around their heads, detect electrical fields as faint as a few billionths of a volt per centimeter. A fish’s muscle twitch under sand, a heartbeat in murky water—nothing escapes their notice. This isn’t just hunting; it’s electroreception, a sense so refined it borders on the supernatural. This isn’t just biology. It’s why sharks navigate oceans with unerring accuracy, sensing the Earth’s magnetic field like an invisible map. It’s how they’ve ruled as apex predators for millions of years, turning darkness and chaos into a grid of electrical signals. Evolution didn’t just adapt sharks to the ocean—it wired them into its hidden currents. Three related subjects are the role of magnetoreception in animal migration, the evolution of extreme sensory systems in predators, and how human electromagnetic noise is drowning out nature’s signals.",
