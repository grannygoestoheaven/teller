  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Pulse—\n\nA heartbeat in the dark, syncopated with the hum of unseen machines. It thrums beneath skin, a metronome for the living, counting down in veins and wires alike. The pulse is both anchor and alarm—a rhythm that betrays life’s fragility, its relentless insistence on now. In hospitals, it flickers on screens like a dying star; in cities, it’s the bassline of traffic, the stutter of neon signs gasping to stay lit.\n\nIt is the first thing we lose when we vanish.\nThe last thing we chase when we’re found.\n\nA pulse doesn’t lie. It swells with fear, flutters with love, stalls at the edge of a name half-remembered. It’s the only truth a body tells without words—until it doesn’t. Then, silence. Then, the long unspooling of everything that once kept time.",
