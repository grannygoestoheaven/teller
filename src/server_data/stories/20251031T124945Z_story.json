  "clean": "Quantum entanglement.  Superposition.  Non-locality.  Quantum mechanics presents a framework for understanding the physical properties of nature at the smallest scales.  One of its most intriguing phenomena is quantum entanglement, where particles become interconnected such that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.  This phenomenon challenges classical intuitions about locality and separability.  Superposition, another cornerstone of quantum theory, posits that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.  This principle underpins the operation of quantum computers, which harness the power of qubits to perform complex calculations more efficiently than classical computers.  The implications for fields like cryptography and data processing are profound, offering potential advancements in speed and security.  Non-locality, a concept tied to entanglement, defies the notion that objects are only influenced by their immediate surroundings.  Experiments such as the Bell test have empirically validated non-local interactions, reinforcing the idea that quantum mechanics operates beyond classical constraints.  These findings continue to inspire debates about the nature of reality and the limits of human understanding.  Three related subjects are quantum computing applications, the philosophical implications of quantum theory, and advancements in quantum cryptography.",
