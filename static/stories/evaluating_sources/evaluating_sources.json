  "clean_story": "\"Fact-checking. Truth-seeking. Evaluating sources means assessing the reliability and accuracy of information. It’s like being a detective, carefully examining clues to determine what’s trustworthy and what’s not. \\nEvaluating sources is crucial in today’s world, where information spreads quickly and not all of it is accurate. Imagine you’re reading an article about a new scientific discovery. How do you know if the information is reliable? You might check the author’s credentials, look for citations, or see if other reputable sources support the claims. \\nOne common method is the CRAAP test, which stands for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose. This framework helps you assess the quality of a source by asking questions like, 'Is the information up-to-date?' and 'Does the author have expertise in the subject?' For example, if you’re researching medical advice, you’d want to ensure the source is written by a qualified professional and published recently. \\nEvaluating sources isn’t just about finding the right answer; it’s about understanding the process. It’s like learning to cook—you don’t just follow a recipe; you learn how to taste and adjust as you go. This skill is especially important in fields like journalism, academia, and law, where accuracy is critical. \\nThree related subjects are the impact of misinformation, the role of algorithms in shaping what we see online, and the ethical responsibilities of content creators. \"",
