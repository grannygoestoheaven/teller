  "clean_story": "Recycling techniques, fiber separation. Rag processes involve the transformation of discarded textiles into reusable materials. This method begins with the collection of old garments and fabrics, which are then sorted based on fiber type and color. Sorting ensures that the resulting material maintains consistent quality. Once sorted, the textiles undergo shredding to break them down into fibers. The shredded fibers are cleaned to remove impurities such as dirt and dyes. This cleaning process often employs mechanical and chemical methods to ensure thorough purification. After cleaning, the fibers are carded, aligning them to form a continuous web. This web is then spun into yarn, ready for weaving or knitting. Rag processes contribute significantly to waste reduction by repurposing textiles that would otherwise end up in landfills. The process also conserves resources by reducing the need for virgin materials. Additionally, it supports sustainable practices within the textile industry. Three related subjects are textile recycling innovations, sustainable fashion practices, and waste management strategies.",
