  "clean": "Memory anomalies.  Temporal lobe activity.  Cognitive recognition.  Perception of familiarity.  The déjà-vu effect is a psychological phenomenon where an individual feels an overwhelming sense of familiarity with something that should not be familiar at all.  This sensation often arises suddenly, without warning, and can be triggered by a specific environment, conversation, or event.  Studies suggest that déjà-vu may be linked to the temporal lobe, a region of the brain responsible for processing memories.  The experience is not uncommon, with many people reporting having encountered it at least once in their lives.  Research into the déjà-vu effect indicates that it may involve a misfiring of neurons in the brain, leading to a false sense of memory.  Some theories propose that it is caused by a split-second delay in the transmission of information between the hemispheres of the brain, resulting in the perception that an event is being experienced for the second time.  Others suggest that it may be a form of memory retrieval error, where the brain retrieves a similar memory and mistakenly associates it with the current situation.  While the exact cause of déjà-vu remains elusive, it is generally considered a benign occurrence.  It is not typically associated with any medical conditions, although it can be more frequent in individuals with epilepsy or anxiety disorders.  The study of déjà-vu continues to intrigue researchers, as it offers insights into the complexities of human memory and perception.
