  "clean_story": "\"Yellow fruit. Sour taste. A lemon is a citrus fruit known for its bright yellow color and tangy flavor. The word 'lemon' comes from the Arabic 'laymūn,' reflecting its journey from Asia to Europe. \\n\\nPeople often think of lemons as just a sour fruit for lemonade or tea. But inside, they’re like tiny factories producing vitamin C and citric acid. These elements help keep our bodies healthy by boosting our immune system and aiding digestion. Lemons also have a special oil in their peel called limonene, which gives them their fresh scent. \\n\\nImagine squeezing a lemon over fish to make it taste better. That’s because the acid in lemons can change the texture of food, making it more tender. In the kitchen, lemons are like a secret ingredient that can brighten up flavors, much like adding a splash of color to a painting. \\n\\nLemons grow on trees in warm places like California and Italy. They start as small green fruits and turn yellow as they ripen. Farmers pick them by hand to avoid bruising, ensuring they stay fresh and juicy. \\n\\nLemons aren’t just for eating. Their juice can clean surfaces, and their scent can freshen up a room. They’re a versatile tool in both cooking and cleaning. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the history of citrus fruits, the science of taste, and the global trade of tropical fruits. \"",
