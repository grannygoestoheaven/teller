  "clean": "Cognitive ease.  The illusion of validity.  Anchoring.  Loss aversion.  Thinking Fast and Slow, authored by Daniel Kahneman, delves into the dual systems of human thought: System 1 and System 2.  System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.  It is the source of intuitive judgments and impressions.  In contrast, System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.  The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.  Kahneman explores how these systems shape our judgments and decisions.  He illustrates how System 1 is prone to biases and errors, particularly when it encounters situations that require more deliberate thought.  For instance, cognitive biases such as the availability heuristic and anchoring are products of System 1's quick assessments.  System 2, while more reliable, is often lazy and may endorse or rationalize the intuitive answers of System 1.  The book also examines the concept of loss aversion, where losses loom larger than gains in our minds.  This tendency influences our decision-making, often leading to risk-averse behavior.  Kahneman's insights into the interplay between the two systems provide a comprehensive understanding of human cognition.  His work emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of our intuitive thinking and the need for more deliberate reasoning in certain contexts.
