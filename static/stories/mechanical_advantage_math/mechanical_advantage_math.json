  "clean_story": "Lifting heavy with less effort.  Math that multiplies your strength. \"Mechanical advantage\" means using tools to turn small forces into big results—like a lever or pulley system doing the heavy lifting for you. Imagine trying to lift a boulder with your hands. Now imagine using a long stick and a rock as a pivot—suddenly, the same push moves tons. That’s mechanical advantage in action. The math is simple:Divide the weight you’re moving by the force you apply. If a 100-pound rock lifts with 20 pounds of effort, your advantage is 5. Five times stronger—just by rearranging the setup. Real-world tools rely on this. A wheelbarrow’s handles act like a lever, letting you carry loads heavier than your arms could alone. Scissors use two levers at once, slicing paper with half the hand strength. Even your jaw is a lever system—muscles pull near the hinge, so a small bite crushes tough food. The trade-off?Distance. To lift that boulder higher, you must push the stick farther. Energy stays the same—you just spread it out. Three related subjects are simple machine physics, efficiency in engineering, and how animals use leverage.",
