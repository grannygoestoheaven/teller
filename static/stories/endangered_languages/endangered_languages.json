  "clean_story": "**Vanishing voices. Living libraries.**\n\nThe term *endangered language* describes a human tongue at risk of disappearing—like a library burning before its books are read.\n\nMost languages don’t die in silence. They fade when their last fluent speakers pass away, or when younger generations stop using them. Imagine if English vanished because kids only texted in emojis—except here, the stakes are higher. A language holds unique words for local plants, weather patterns, or emotions no other tongue captures. When it’s gone, so is that knowledge.\n\nTake **Tuvan**, spoken in Siberia. Its throat-singing techniques mimic mountain winds and rivers—sounds impossible in English. Or **Ayapaneco** in Mexico, where two elderly men once refused to speak to each other, leaving their language unrecorded. Some languages, like **Siletz Dee-ni** in Oregon, were revived after decades of dormancy, thanks to audio recordings and tribal elders.\n\nThe **UN estimates 40% of the world’s 7,000+ languages** could vanish by 2100. Why? Globalization pushes dominant languages (English, Mandarin, Spanish) into schools and media. Younger generations often see ancestral tongues as \"useless\" for jobs or tech. Yet, **Hawaiian** bounced back after parents demanded immersion schools. **Welsh** thrives because road signs and TV use it.\n\nPrecision matters. A **single word** in **Inuit** distinguishes 50 types of snow—critical for survival. **Pirahã** in the Amazon lacks numbers or past tense, reshaping how its speakers think of time. These aren’t quirks; they’re tools for navigating the world.\n\nWhat’s lost isn’t just words. It’s **medicinal secrets** (like **Kallawaya** healers’ plant names), **oral histories**, or **legal systems** (e.g., **Maori** land rights encoded in proverbs). Some languages, like **Ainu** in Japan, are tied to rituals—once the language dies, so do the ceremonies.\n\nEfforts to save them vary. Apps like **FirstVoices** archive Indigenous words. **Wiktionary** hosts endangered-language dictionaries. In New Zealand, **te reo Māori** is now taught in schools, and **Google Translate** added it in 2023. But tech isn’t enough. **Revitalization requires speakers**—people who’ll teach their kids, sing in their tongue, or text in it.\n\nThe clock ticks faster for languages with **fewer than 1,000 speakers**. **Lemerig** (Vanuatu) has 2. **Dumi** (Nepal) has 7. **Chemehuevi** (California) has 3 elders. Yet, **Hebrew** was dead for 2,000 years before Israel revived it. **Cornish**, extinct by 1800, now has 500 speakers.\n\nThe question isn’t just *how* languages die—it’s *why we let them*. Every lost word is a thread cut from humanity’s fabric.\n\n**Memory without words.** **Sounds only animals hear.** **The math of silence.**",
