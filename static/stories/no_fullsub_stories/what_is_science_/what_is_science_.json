  "clean_story": "Science. Discovering how the world works. The word 'science' comes from the Latin *scientia*, meaning 'knowledge. ' It’s about asking questions and testing ideas to understand nature, technology, and even ourselves. \\n\\nPeople often think of science as just facts in textbooks, but it’s really a process of curiosity and experimentation. Scientists start with observations—like noticing that plants grow toward light—and then design experiments to test their ideas. For example, if you want to know what helps plants grow best, you might test different amounts of sunlight or water, keeping everything else the same. This way, you can see what really makes a difference. \\n\\nScience isn’t just about big labs or complicated equipment. It can be as simple as baking cookies and adjusting ingredients to see what makes them taste better. Even something like figuring out the best way to pack a suitcase is a kind of science—you’re testing different arrangements to find the most efficient one. The key is asking questions, trying things out, and learning from the results. \\n\\nOne of the coolest things about science is that it’s always evolving. New discoveries can change what we thought we knew, like when scientists realized the Earth isn’t the center of the solar system. This keeps science exciting because there’s always more to explore. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how curiosity drives innovation, the role of failure in scientific progress, and the ways science shapes our everyday lives.",
