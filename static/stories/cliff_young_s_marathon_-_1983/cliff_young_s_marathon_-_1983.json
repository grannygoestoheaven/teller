Opening: Cliff Young was a 61-year-old potato farmer when he entered the inaugural Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon in 1983. He wore overalls and work boots, not the typical running gear, and his participation seemed like a joke to many.<[silence]>\n\n2. Etymology: The term \"ultramarathon\" refers to any footrace longer than the traditional marathon length of 42.195 kilometers, originating from the Latin \"ultra,\" meaning \"beyond.\"<[silence]>\n\n3. Spark Event: Young's defining moment came when he shuffled past younger, more experienced runners, maintaining his slow but steady pace. His unconventional approach, which included running through the night without sleep, led him to victory.<[silence]>\n\n4. Mechanism: Young's method was akin to the tortoise in Aesop's fable, relying on endurance rather than speed. Unlike other competitors who slept for six hours each night, Young ran continuously, closing the gap and eventually overtaking them. For example, on the third night, while others rested, Young's relentless shuffle gained him significant ground.<[silence]>\n\n5. Impact: Young's victory shattered preconceived notions about age and athleticism, proving that determination and strategy could triumph over conventional training. His win also inspired the creation of new ultramarathon strategies, emphasizing endurance over speed.<[silence]>\n\n6. Related: The story of Cliff Young relates to the concepts of grit, non-conformity, and the psychology of endurance sports. It also parallels stories of underdogs who defy expectations, like the Jamaican bobsled team and the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team.<[silence]>",
