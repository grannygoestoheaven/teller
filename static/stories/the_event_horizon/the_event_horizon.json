  "clean_story": "Poi t of o retur . Space’s ultimate trapdoor. The ame comes from ships at sea: the eve t horizo is the li e where waves va ish from view—a d i space, it’s where light itself ca ’t escape. Black holes do ’t suck thi gs i like a vacuum. They’re more like a waterfall’s edge. Swim too close, a d the curre t pulls you over. Past the eve t horizo , the river flows faster tha you ca paddle—eve light, the u iverse’s speed champio , gets dragged u der. Imagi e a flashlight beam aimed outward. Outside the horizo , the light streaks away. At the horizo , it freezes—stretched i to i visibility. I side, it ever reaches your eyes. The black hole’s gravity warps time so severely that, to a outside observer, you’d appear to slow, the halt, the fade like a dyi g ember. <[sile ce:500]> Records show the first real image of a eve t horizo (M87, 2019) took a telescope the size of Earth. The black hole’s shadow was 2.5 times wider tha the horizo itself—a cosmic mirage, be di g light i to a ri g. Gravity’s bli d spot. Time’s fi al tick. The u iverse’s delete key. Curiosity trails: spacetime geometry, i formatio paradox, the fate of si gularities.",
