This phenomenon was identified by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999.  Their research demonstrated that people lacking skills in a specific area often fail to recognize their own incompetence.  This leads them to mistakenly believe they are more skilled than they actually are.  The effect is not limited to any particular field and can be observed in diverse areas such as academia, business, and everyday decision-making.  The Dunning-Kruger Effect is characterized by a pattern where individuals with low ability at a task overestimate their ability, while those with high ability tend to underestimate their competence.  This misalignment occurs because the skills needed to produce correct responses are the same skills required to recognize correct responses.  As a result, those lacking skills are not only incompetent but also unable to recognize their own lack of competence.  Conversely, those with high competence may assume others possess similar skills, leading to an underestimation of their own abilities.  The implications of the Dunning-Kruger Effect extend into various aspects of life, influencing personal and professional interactions.
