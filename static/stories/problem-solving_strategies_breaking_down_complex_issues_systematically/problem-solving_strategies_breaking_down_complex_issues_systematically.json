  "clean_story": "Breaking down problems. Solving them step by step. The term 'breaking down' means dividing a big problem into smaller, easier parts. It’s like taking apart a puzzle to see how each piece fits together. When faced with a complex issue, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But by breaking it down, you can tackle one small part at a time. For example, imagine you’re building a treehouse. Instead of trying to build the whole thing at once, you’d start with the foundation, then the walls, and finally the roof. Each step is manageable on its own, but together, they create something big. This approach is used in many fields, from science to business. Engineers break down large projects into smaller tasks, and doctors diagnose illnesses by examining symptoms one by one. By focusing on each part, they can solve the whole problem more effectively. Breaking down complex issues systematically helps you understand them better and find solutions faster. Three related subjects are how to prioritize tasks, the importance of planning, and the role of teamwork in solving big problems.",
