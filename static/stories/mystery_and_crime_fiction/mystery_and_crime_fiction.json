  "clean_story": "**Hidden clues. Unseen motives.**\n\nThe term *mystery and crime fiction* refers to stories where a puzzle—often a crime—drives the plot, and the solution depends on logic, observation, or a sudden reveal.\n\nThese stories thrive on **what’s missing**: a stolen object, a lie in a witness’s statement, or a detail no one noticed. Like a jigsaw puzzle with one piece flipped upside down, the fun lies in spotting the mismatch. The genre splits into two core types: **whodunits** (solving *who* committed the crime) and **howcatchems** (stopping a criminal mid-act). Both rely on **red herrings**—false clues meant to mislead—like a suspect’s alibi that seems airtight until a train schedule proves it fake.\n\nReal-world tools mirror fiction’s tricks. **Fingerprint powder** (used since the 1890s) makes invisible marks visible, just as a detective might dust a suspect’s glass for prints. **Poisons** like arsenic—odorless, tasteless—became a favorite in 19th-century crimes (and stories) because they left no obvious trace. Agatha Christie’s *The Mysterious Affair at Styles* (1920) used strychnine’s muscle spasms as a clue, while Dorothy L. Sayers’ *Strong Poison* (1930) hinged on arsenic’s slow accumulation in hair.\n\nThe best stories exploit **human blind spots**. In *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* (1926), Christie broke rules by making the narrator the killer—a trick that works because readers trust first-person accounts. Modern procedurals like *CSI* use **luminol**, a chemical that glows blue under UV light when it touches blood, even if the stain was scrubbed away. A single drop, invisible to the eye, can convict.\n\nWhat makes these stories endure? **The gap between appearance and truth.** A locked-room mystery isn’t about the door—it’s about the chimney, the secret panel, or the victim who wasn’t murdered at all. The thrill isn’t the violence; it’s the **ah-ha** moment when the puzzle clicks.\n\nForensic linguistics. Psychological manipulation. The perfect alibi that isn’t.",
