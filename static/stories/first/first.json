  "clean_story": "\"The start of everything.  A boundary with no before. 'First' marks the initial instance—the moment something begins where nothing like it existed. Like the crack of a bat hitting the first pitch of a game,  but for time itself. We assume 'firsts' are obvious—birthdays, sunrises, footsteps on the moon. Yet the real intrigue lies in what defines them. A chicken’s egg isn’t first until a mutation makes it unmistakably a chicken’s,  not a proto-bird’s. Or consider the first word spoken: Not a grunt or cry,  but a sound tied to meaning—‘water’ pointing to a stream,  repeated until others mirrored it. Firsts demand three things: A clear before-and-after,  a record (even if it’s just memory),  and irrevocable change. The first domesticated wolf became a dog when its pups sought human eyes for cues,  not just food. Three related subjects are origin paradoxes, thresholds in evolution, and how we measure beginnings.",
