  "clean_story": "Endocannabinoid system. Neurotransmitter modulation. The brain's response to physical attraction is a complex interplay of various neurotransmitters and receptors. Under the influence of THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, this interplay can be altered. THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating mood, pleasure, and reward. By binding to cannabinoid receptors, THC can modulate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, potentially heightening feelings of attraction. Dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter affected by THC. Serotonin, which influences mood and social behavior, can also be modulated. THC may enhance serotonin release, contributing to a relaxed and open state of mind. This altered state can make individuals more receptive to social cues and physical attraction. The combination of increased dopamine and serotonin activity can create a heightened perception of attractiveness in others. Additionally, THC's effect on the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotional processing, can influence attraction. The amygdala helps interpret social signals and emotional expressions. Under THC, the amygdala's response to these signals may be intensified, leading to a stronger emotional connection or attraction. This can result in a more profound appreciation of another person's physical presence and attributes. Three related subjects are the effects of THC on social anxiety, the role of oxytocin in human bonding, and the influence of cannabis on memory and perception.",
