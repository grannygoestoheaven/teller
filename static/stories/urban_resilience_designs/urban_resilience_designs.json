Disasters they withstand. \"Urban resilience designs\" means building cities like sponges\u2014not rigid walls\u2014so they absorb shocks instead of breaking. Most see skyscrapers as strength, but resilience hides in the gaps:parks that flood on purpose, roads that crack in predictable patterns, power grids that reroute like ant trails when a line fails.

Or Tokyo\u2019s seismic joints:Rubber bearings between buildings and foundations let them slide 30cm side-to-side in an earthquake, like a tree swaying in wind. The math is precise:New Orleans\u2019 post-Katrina levees now use \"I-walls\" with deep soil anchors\u2014designed to resist 100-year floods and slowly erode if overwhelmed, buying hours for evacuation.
