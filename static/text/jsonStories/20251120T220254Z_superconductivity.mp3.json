  "clean": "Quantum tunneling, Meissner effect, Cooper pairs.\n\n Superconductivity is a phenomenon observed in certain materials where electrical resistance drops to zero when cooled below a specific critical temperature.  This state allows for the unimpeded flow of electric current, a feature that distinguishes superconductors from ordinary conductors.  The absence of electrical resistance is accompanied by the expulsion of magnetic fields, known as the Meissner effect, which is a defining characteristic of superconductors.  The discovery of superconductivity dates back to 1911 when Heike Kamerlingh Onnes observed it in mercury at 4. 2 Kelvin.  The underlying mechanism of superconductivity is explained by the BCS theory, named after John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer.  According to this theory, electrons in a superconductor form pairs known as Cooper pairs, which move through the lattice structure of the material without scattering.  This pairing is facilitated by lattice vibrations, or phonons, which create an attractive force between electrons.  The formation of Cooper pairs is essential for the superconducting state, as it allows for the coherent movement of electrons, resulting in zero resistance.  Superconductors are classified into two types: Type I and Type II.  Type I superconductors are characterized by a complete loss of resistance and a total expulsion of magnetic fields, but they can only sustain superconductivity under relatively low magnetic fields.  Type II superconductors, on the other hand, can maintain their superconducting properties even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, allowing for a partial penetration of magnetic lines through the material in quantized units called vortices.  This distinction makes Type II superconductors more suitable for practical applications, such as in the construction of powerful electromagnets.  Recent advancements in high-temperature superconductors have sparked considerable interest due to their potential applications in technology and industry.  These materials exhibit superconductivity at temperatures significantly higher than those of conventional superconductors, though still below room temperature.  The pursuit of room-temperature superconductors remains a significant goal in the field, as they promise to revolutionize energy transmission and storage.
