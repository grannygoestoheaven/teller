  "clean_story": "\"Death. Mortality. The inevitable end of life. The term 'mortality' comes from the Latin 'mors,' meaning death. It's the state of being subject to death, a universal constant. \\n\\nDeath is often perceived as a grim reaper, a silent, faceless force. But it's also a complex, intricate process, deeply intertwined with life. It's the final stage of a biological journey, as precise and unique as the life that preceded it. \\n\\nConsider the great white shark, a master of precision hunting. Its death is no less precise. It doesn't simply 'die'—it succumbs to a cascade of physiological changes. Its heart stops, blood ceases to flow, and its brain activity flatlines. This process, called circulatory death, is the medical definition of death. \\n\\nBut even this isn't the end. Death triggers a chain reaction, from the decomposition of the body to the recycling of nutrients. It fuels new life, from the bacteria that break down flesh to the scavengers that feed on the remains. Death is the ultimate recycler, the great equalizer. \\n\\nYet, death isn't always immediate or absolute. In some cases, like organ donation, death is declared based on the irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain, known as brain death. This allows for organ transplants, extending life for others. It's a testament to the complexity and adaptability of life and death. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the ethical debates surrounding definitions of death, the role of death in driving evolution, and the cultural rituals and practices that help us cope with mortality. \"\n\n(Char count: 849)",
