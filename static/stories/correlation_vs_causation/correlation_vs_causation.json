  "clean_story": "Correlation measures how two things move together. Causation explains why one thing causes another. Correlation is like noticing that ice cream sales and drowning incidents both rise in summer. It doesn’t mean ice cream causes drowning, though. The real reason is that people are more likely to swim in summer, leading to both more ice cream sales and more drownings. This is causation. Correlation is just the observation; causation is the explanation. For example, studies might find that people who carry a certain gene are more likely to develop a disease. This is a correlation. But if scientists then prove that the gene directly affects how cells function, causing the disease, that’s causation. Correlation is like seeing two cars moving at the same speed on a highway. They might be going the same way, but one isn’t necessarily causing the other to move. Causation would be if one car’s engine failure caused the other to slow down because of traffic. Three related subjects are how statistics can mislead, the challenges of proving cause and effect in science, and the role of chance in everyday life.",
