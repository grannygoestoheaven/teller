  "clean_story": "Heavy heart.  Tears without words. \"Sadness\" comes from the Old English sædnes, meaning \"weariness of mind\"—like a muscle too tired to lift even small things. It’s not just an emotion; it’s a slow, physical weight. Your chest tightens like a fist clenching a sponge,your breath shallow as if the air itself is thicker. Science calls this the \"freeze response\"—your brain’s ancient wiring,the same system that makes deer still in headlights,now turning inward. Tears aren’t weakness;they’re stress hormones leaving your body,like sweat after a run. Crying lowers manganese levels—too much and aggression spikes. Sadness carves time differently:Five minutes feels like fifty,because your brain replays moments like a scratched record,searching for what you missed. Even music sounds flattened—studies show sadness reduces your ability to detect pitch changes by 30%. Yet it’s not all loss. Sadness sharpens empathy;people who’ve just cried can better recognize fear in others’ faces. Three related subjects are grief’s physical stages, how art channels sorrow, and why nostalgia hurts so precisely.",
