  "clean_story": "\"Power to the people. Shared decision-making. The word 'democracy' comes from Greek, meaning 'rule by the people. ' It’s like a group project where everyone gets a vote on how to do things. \\nDemocracy is often seen as the best way to make fair decisions, but it’s not always simple. Imagine a class voting on what to do for recess. Some kids might want to play soccer, others might want to draw. Democracy means finding a way to make sure everyone’s voice is heard, even if not everyone gets exactly what they want. \\nOne key part of democracy is elections. People vote for leaders or ideas, and the majority wins. But democracy isn’t just about voting—it’s also about making sure everyone has a fair chance to be heard. This can mean things like free speech, fair trials, and equal rights. \\nDemocracy isn’t perfect. Sometimes, groups with more power or influence can sway decisions in their favor. Other times, people might not vote because they feel their voice doesn’t matter. But the goal is to keep improving the system so it works better for everyone. \\nThree related subjects are how different countries practice democracy, the challenges of making sure every vote counts, and the role of protests in shaping laws. \"",
