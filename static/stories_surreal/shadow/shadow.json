  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Shadow—neither light nor absence, but the ghost between. It clings like a second skin, stretching long at dusk, shrinking to a stub at noon, a silent metronome for the sun’s passage. It swallows edges whole, softening the world into smudged charcoal sketches, where depth is just an illusion of contrast.\n\nA shadow is memory’s accomplice: it lingers where bodies once stood, a hollow imprint of motion—fingers that brushed walls, footsteps that never quite left. It whispers in the language of negative space, teaching us that darkness isn’t empty, but a shape-shifter, mimicking what it touches yet never touching back.\n\nAnd when you chase it, it flees; when you turn away, it clings. The first paradox we learn as children. The last one we forget.",
