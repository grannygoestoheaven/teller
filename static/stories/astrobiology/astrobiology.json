  "clean_story": "Astrobiology. Life beyond Earth. The term 'astrobiology' combines 'astro,' meaning space, and 'biology,' the study of life. It’s the science of searching for life in the universe and understanding how it might exist beyond our planet. \\nAstrobiology isn’t just about finding aliens. It’s about studying the conditions that make life possible, whether on Mars, Europa, or exoplanets light-years away. Scientists look for signs of life, like water, organic molecules, or energy sources, and explore how life could adapt to extreme environments. \\nFor example, extremophiles—microbes on Earth that thrive in extreme conditions—offer clues about where life might exist elsewhere. Some live in boiling hot springs, while others survive in icy Antarctic lakes. If life can survive in these harsh places on Earth, it might also survive on other planets. \\nAstrobiology also involves studying the chemistry of life. Scientists analyze meteorites, comets, and even the atmospheres of distant planets to see if they contain the building blocks of life, like amino acids or complex organic molecules. \\nThree related subjects are the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the origins of life on Earth, and the future of human space exploration.",
