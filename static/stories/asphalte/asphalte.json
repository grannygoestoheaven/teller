  "clean_story": "Smooth roads. Endless journeys. The word 'asphalte' derives from the Greek 'asphaltos', meaning secure or stable. In 1870, Belgian chemist Edmond J. DeSmedt laid the first true asphalt pavement in Newark, New Jersey. This innovation revolutionized transportation, allowing for faster, safer travel. Asphalt is a mixture of aggregates, binder, and filler. Workers heat it to 300°F, pour it onto surfaces, and compact it. Example: Interstate highways use asphalt for durability and smoothness. Roads built with asphalt reduce vehicle emissions by improving fuel efficiency. Related subjects: civil engineering, urban planning, transportation infrastructure.",
