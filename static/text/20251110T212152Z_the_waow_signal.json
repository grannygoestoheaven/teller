  "clean": "Frequency anomalies. Cosmic phenomena. Radio telescopes. The Waow signal is an intriguing anomaly in radio astronomy, detected on May 15, 2023, by the Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia. Unlike the famous Wow! signal from 1977, the Waow signal was characterized by a unique frequency pattern that did not match any known cosmic or terrestrial sources. The signal lasted for approximately 72 seconds, a duration that allowed for detailed analysis. Its frequency was centered around 1420 MHz, a region of the spectrum often associated with hydrogen emissions. Researchers have been meticulous in their examination of the Waow signal, ruling out interference from satellites, aircraft, and other man-made sources. The signal's origin remains unidentified, sparking interest in the scientific community. It was recorded as a narrowband signal, a feature that distinguishes it from the broader signals typically generated by natural astrophysical processes. This has led to speculation about its possible origin, though no conclusions have been drawn. The Waow signal has prompted discussions about the methods used in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and the development of advanced algorithms to differentiate between genuine cosmic signals and noise. The signal's discovery underscores the need for international collaboration in radio astronomy to verify and study such anomalies. The data collected from the Waow signal continues to be analyzed, with the hope of uncovering further insights. Three related subjects are the Wow! signal of 1977, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), and the role of radio telescopes in modern astronomy.",
