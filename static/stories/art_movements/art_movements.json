  "clean_story": "\"Art. movements. Shaping. culture. The. term. 'art. movement' refers. to. a. group. of. artists. who. share. similar. ideas. and. styles, often. reacting. to. the. world. around. them. Think. of. it. like. a. team. of. chefs. experimenting. with. new. flavors—each. one. brings. their. own. twist, but. they. all. agree. on. the. main. ingredients. \\n. Art. movements. are. born. from. change. They. emerge. when. artists. want. to. break. away. from. old. traditions. or. respond. to. new. ideas. in. society. For. example, Impressionism. came. about. in. the. 19th. century. when. artists. like. Monet. wanted. to. capture. the. fleeting. effects. of. light. and. color, rather. than. painting. realistic. details. like. their. predecessors. did. \\n. Each. movement. has. its. own. rules. and. techniques. Cubism, for. instance, broke. objects. into. geometric. shapes, while. Surrealism. explored. dreams. and. the. unconscious. mind. These. styles. can. be. seen. in. famous. works. like. Picasso’s. fragmented. portraits. or. Dalí’s. melting. clocks. \\n. Art. movements. don’t. just. stay. in. galleries—they. influence. fashion, design, and. even. technology. The. bold. colors. of. Fauvism. inspired. clothing. designs, while. the. minimalism. of. Bauhaus. shaped. modern. furniture. and. architecture. They’re. like. ripples. in. a. pond, spreading. far. beyond. the. original. splash. \\n. Of. course, not. everyone. agrees. on. what. makes. a. movement. Some. argue. that. labeling. art. can. limit. creativity, while. others. see. it. as. a. way. to. understand. cultural. shifts. But. whether. you. love. or. hate. the. categories, there’s. no. denying. that. these. collective. efforts. have. shaped. how. we. see. the. world. \\n.",
