  "clean_story": "\"Earth's dynamic skin. Continental drift. The term 'plate tectonics' combines 'tectonics,' the study of Earth's structure, and 'plates,' the massive, moving fragments of its crust. Imagine Earth's outer shell as a jigsaw puzzle, with pieces called plates floating on a molten interior. Most people know about the theory of continental drift, but the intricacies of how these plates move and interact are less understood. Plates can collide, spread apart, or slide alongside each other, driven by the convection currents in Earth's mantle. This constant motion shapes our planet's surface, creating mountains, oceans, and even influencing climate. Consider the Himalayas, born from the collision of India and Eurasia plates, or the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American and Eurasian plates are slowly pulling apart, creating new ocean floor. The precision of plate tectonics is evident in the fit of Africa and South America's coastlines, like pieces of a puzzle. Yet, this motion is slow, about the speed your fingernails grow. It's also not evenly distributed, leading to areas of intense activity, like the 'Ring of Fire' around the Pacific, and stable zones. Three related subjects are the role of plate tectonics in mass extinctions, the potential for harnessing geothermal energy from plate boundaries, and the challenges of mapping the ever-changing seafloor. \"",
