  "clean_story": "Sound shapes.  Meaning containers. \"Word\" comes from Old English word, tied to werdan—\"to speak. \"Words are like Lego blocks for thought. Alone, a block is simple—cat, run, blue. Snap them together, and suddenly you’ve built a castle or a storm. Take the word serendipity. Coined in 1754 by Horace Walpole, inspired by a Persian fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip. It labels the accident of finding something wonderful while searching for another. No other word does that job. Or petrichor—the scent of rain on dry earth. Invented in 1964 by scientists Isabel Joy Bear and Richard Thomas. They isolated the oil released by plants during drought, trapped in rocks, then freed by rainfall. A single word captures an entire hidden process. Words die too. Flibbertigibbet once meant a flighty person—now it’s a ghost in dictionaries. Snollygoster (a shrewd, unprincipled person) faded after its 1840s political heyday. Yet new ones spawn daily. <[silence:1600ms>\"Selfie\" entered Oxford Dictionaries in 2013. <[silence:1600ms>\"Hangry\" merged hunger and anger by 2015. Three related subjects are how brains store words, dead languages’ lost sounds, and emoji as modern hieroglyphs.",
