  "clean": "Quantum entanglement, superconductivity, photonic crystals, topological insulators.  Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected, such that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.  This non-local interaction challenges classical notions of locality and has been experimentally validated through numerous tests, including Bell's theorem experiments.  Its implications extend to quantum computing and secure communication technologies.  Superconductivity refers to the property of certain materials to conduct electricity without resistance below a specific temperature.  This phenomenon was first discovered in mercury at 4. 2 Kelvin.  High-temperature superconductors, such as cuprates, have since been identified, operating at temperatures above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.  Their potential applications include magnetic levitation and lossless power transmission.  Photonic crystals are optical materials that manipulate the flow of light.  They possess a periodic structure on the scale of the wavelength of light, creating photonic band gaps.  These structures are used in developing efficient light-emitting diodes, lasers, and optical fibers.  Their ability to control light propagation has significant implications for telecommunications and information processing.  Topological insulators are materials that conduct electricity on their surface but act as insulators internally.  They have unique electronic properties due to their topological order, which is robust against perturbations.  These materials hold promise for spintronics and quantum computing.  Their study is an active area of research in condensed matter physics.  Three related subjects are quantum computing, nanotechnology, and spintronics.",
