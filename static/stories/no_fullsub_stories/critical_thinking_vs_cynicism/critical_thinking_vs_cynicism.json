  "clean_story": "Critical thinking. Cynicism’s shadow. The word 'critical' comes from 'critique,' meaning to analyze carefully. Cynicism, however, means distrusting everything without reason. Both start with questions, but one seeks truth, the other assumes lies. Imagine you’re solving a puzzle. Critical thinking is like turning each piece to see how it fits. Cynicism is assuming the puzzle is missing pieces before you even try. The first approach leads to understanding; the second, to frustration. Critical thinking is a skill. It involves gathering facts, weighing evidence, and considering different perspectives. For example, if a friend says, 'This new app is terrible,' a critical thinker might ask, 'What problems have you encountered?' and 'Have others had different experiences?' This way, they form a balanced opinion. Cynicism, on the other hand, often skips the evidence. It’s like saying, 'All politicians lie,' without examining their specific actions or statements. While skepticism can be healthy, cynicism dismisses everything without fair evaluation. It’s like refusing to taste a meal because you assume it’s bad, even before trying it. Three related subjects are the psychology of skepticism, how bias affects decision-making, and the role of curiosity in learning.",
