  "clean_story": "\"Knowledge from reason. Knowledge from experience. The terms 'a priori' and 'a posteriori' come from Latin, meaning 'from what comes before' and 'from what comes after,' respectively. They describe two ways of knowing things. A priori knowledge is like math. It’s based on logic and doesn’t need proof from the real world. For example, 'All bachelors are unmarried men' is true just by definition. You don’t need to check the world to know it’s true. A posteriori knowledge, on the other hand, comes from experience. It’s like saying 'The sun will rise tomorrow'—you believe it because you’ve seen it happen every day. This kind of knowledge depends on evidence from the world. A classic example is the statement 'All swans are white. ' Before discovering black swans in Australia, people thought this was a priori truth. But once they saw black swans, they realized it was actually a posteriori knowledge. This shows how experience can change what we think we know. A priori knowledge is often seen as more certain because it’s based on logic. But a posteriori knowledge is more practical for understanding the world. Together, they help us balance abstract reasoning with real-world evidence. \"",
