  "clean": "Hydrodynamic outflows. Stellar wind interactions. Gravitational influence. Atmospheric composition. Atmospheric escape in exoplanets refers to the process where gases from a planet's atmosphere are lost to space. This phenomenon is influenced by several factors, including the planet's gravity, the intensity of radiation from its host star, and the composition of the atmosphere itself. Hydrodynamic escape occurs when the upper layers of an atmosphere are heated to the point where particles gain enough energy to overcome gravitational pull. This is particularly prevalent in young, hot exoplanets where stellar radiation is intense. Stellar wind interactions also play a significant role in atmospheric escape. Stellar winds, streams of charged particles emitted by stars, can strip away atmospheric particles from exoplanets, especially those in close proximity to their stars. The effectiveness of this process depends on the magnetic field of the exoplanet, which can either shield the atmosphere or allow for more substantial loss. Observations have shown that planets with weak magnetic fields are more susceptible to atmospheric erosion. Gravitational influence is another key factor in determining the rate of atmospheric escape. Larger exoplanets with stronger gravitational fields are generally better at retaining their atmospheres compared to smaller, less massive ones. However, the composition of the atmosphere also affects this process. Lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, are more likely to escape than heavier elements like oxygen and nitrogen. This selective escape can significantly alter the atmospheric composition over time. Three related subjects are the role of magnetic fields in atmospheric retention, the impact of stellar activity on exoplanetary atmospheres, and the study of atmospheric composition in determining habitability.",
