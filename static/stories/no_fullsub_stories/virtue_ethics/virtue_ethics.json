  "clean_story": "\"Moral character. Action guidance. Virtue ethics combines 'virtue' and 'ethics,' emphasizing moral character and actions. It traces back to Aristotle, who believed virtues are habits that help us flourish. Unlike deontological or consequentialist ethics, virtue ethics focuses on the actor's character, not just the action's outcome or rules. \\n\\nImagine a soldier facing a moral dilemma. A consequentialist might ask, 'What results in the most good?' A deontologist might consider, 'What are my duties?' A virtue ethicist asks, 'What would a virtuous person do?' This isn't about following a rulebook, but acting from a place of integrity and wisdom. \\n\\nVirtue ethics isn't about being perfect, but striving for balance. Aristotle's 'golden mean' suggests virtues lie between excess and deficiency. Courage, for instance, is the balance between cowardice and recklessness. This balance is context-dependent, requiring practical wisdom (phronesis) to navigate. \\n\\nVirtue ethics has its trade-offs. It can be subjective, relying on personal judgment. It also assumes we have control over our actions and characters, which isn't always true. Moreover, it can struggle with complex, unprecedented situations where no clear virtue applies. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the role of emotions in virtue ethics, the challenge of teaching and cultivating virtues, and the intersection of virtue ethics with other ethical theories. \"",
