  "clean_story": "\"Time’s flow. A human construct. The word 'time' comes from the Old English 'tīma,' meaning a measure of duration. But is it real, or just a way we organize events?Imagine time as a river, with events floating along its current. To us, it feels real because we experience cause and effect—like dropping a stone into the water and seeing ripples spread. But some scientists argue that time might not flow at all. Instead, past, present, and future could all exist simultaneously, like pages in a book. We only perceive one page at a time, but the whole book is already written. Einstein’s theory of relativity shows that time isn’t absolute. A clock on a fast-moving spaceship ticks slower than one on Earth. This means time can stretch or shrink depending on speed and gravity. So, if time isn’t fixed, is it truly 'real' in the way we think?Some physicists propose that time might emerge from deeper layers of reality, like how temperature emerges from the movement of atoms. In this view, time is a useful tool for describing change, but not a fundamental part of the universe. Others suggest that time’s arrow—the sense of moving from past to future—could be an illusion created by entropy, the tendency of systems to become more disordered. Three related subjects are the nature of reality, the search for a unified theory of physics, and how consciousness perceives the passage of time. \"",
