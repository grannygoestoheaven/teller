  "clean_story": "\"Approval seeking. Self-neglect. The paradox of pleasing involves striving to gain others' approval at the cost of one's own needs. The term 'pleasing' originates from the Latin 'placere,' meaning to satisfy or give pleasure. \\n\\nCommonly seen as a positive trait, pleasing can lead to stress and burnout when overextended. This behavior often stems from a desire to avoid conflict or rejection, yet it paradoxically results in personal dissatisfaction. Mechanisms include saying 'yes' to requests despite personal inconvenience, prioritizing others' opinions over one's own, and suppressing true emotions to maintain harmony. \\n\\nConsider an employee who consistently takes on extra work to be seen as reliable. While initially praised, they may eventually face exhaustion and decreased productivity. Similarly, a friend who always agrees to social plans might feel overwhelmed, leading to resentment. \\n\\nThe impact of this paradox is measurable: studies show chronic people-pleasers experience higher levels of anxiety and lower self-esteem. Addressing this involves setting boundaries and practicing assertiveness, which can improve mental health and relationships. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the psychology of self-worth, the art of boundary-setting, and the societal pressures that shape our behaviors. \"",
