  "clean_story": "Fiery star.  Life’s power source.  The word *sun* comes from Old English *sunne*, a name given to the glowing ball of gas that lights our sky and holds our solar system together. Most see the sun as a steady yellow disk, but it’s a churning nuclear reactor, fusing 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second. This process releases energy that takes 10,000–170,000 years to escape the sun’s dense core before racing to Earth in just 8 minutes. Imagine a lightbulb so powerful it could keep 3 billion identical bulbs lit for a year—using just the energy it emits in one second. The sun’s surface isn’t solid but a 10,000°F plasma soup, where magnetic loops arc like stretched rubber bands, snapping to hurl solar flares into space. One such flare in 1859, the Carrington Event, fried telegraph wires and set papers on fire—today, it could knock out satellites and power grids for months. Yet these storms also create auroras, painting skies green and purple when charged particles collide with Earth’s atmosphere. Without the sun’s gravity, Earth would drift into the void like a leaf in a breeze. Its light fuels photosynthesis, the process turning CO₂ and water into oxygen and sugar—the foundation of nearly all food chains. Even fossil fuels are stored sunlight, pressed into oil and coal over millions of years. In 5 billion years, the sun will exhaust its hydrogen, swell into a red giant, and engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. But long before then, its gradual brightening will boil our oceans, turning Earth into a desert like Venus. Stellar lifecycles.  Magnetic storms.  The quiet violence of fusion.",
