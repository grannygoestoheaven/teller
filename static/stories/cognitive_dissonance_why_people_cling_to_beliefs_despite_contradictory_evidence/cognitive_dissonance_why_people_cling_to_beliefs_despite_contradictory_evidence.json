  "clean_story": "**Cognitive dissonance. The mental tug-of-war. **\nThe term 'cognitive dissonance' describes the discomfort we feel when our beliefs clash with reality. It’s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole—it just doesn’t work, and it’s frustrating. Imagine you believe eating candy is healthy, but every doctor says it’s not. Your brain feels uneasy, like a car engine sputtering because it’s running on the wrong fuel. To reduce this discomfort, you might start believing doctors are wrong or that candy is healthy in moderation. This is cognitive dissonance in action. People often cling to beliefs despite contradictory evidence because changing their minds feels harder than adjusting reality. It’s easier to ignore a few bad test results than to admit you’ve been wrong about something important. For example, someone who smokes might dismiss health warnings as exaggerations rather than quitting. This mental shortcut helps us avoid the pain of admitting we’re wrong, but it can lead to poor decisions. Cognitive dissonance isn’t always bad—it can motivate us to change. If the discomfort of holding onto a belief becomes too great, we might finally take action. For instance, someone who loves their pet but realizes they’re neglecting it might start spending more time with them. The key is recognizing when our beliefs are causing more harm than good. Three related subjects are how our brains form habits, the psychology of decision-making, and why people resist change. \"",
