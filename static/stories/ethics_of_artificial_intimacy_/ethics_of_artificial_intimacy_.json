  "clean_story": "Emotional bonds. Machines simulate them.\n\n\n\"Artificial intimacy\" describes relationships where humans feel close to AI—like chatbots, virtual partners, or even robots—designed to mimic care, friendship, or love.\n\n\nIt’s like talking to a mirror that talks back. The mirror doesn’t feel anything, but it reflects your words so well you might forget.\n\n\nCompanies now sell AI companions: Replika offers a \"best friend\" that learns your habits, while apps like Romantic AI let users craft virtual boyfriends or girlfriends. Some users spend hours daily confiding in these systems, even paying for \"premium\" emotional depth.\n\n\nThe ethical tension? These tools exploit a human need—connection—while offering nothing real in return. Studies show prolonged AI intimacy can shrink real-world social skills, like muscles weakening from disuse. Worse, some users mistake scripted empathy for love, leading to isolation when the AI’s limits become clear.\n\n\nYet the tech isn’t all harm. Therapists use AI chatbots to help patients practice vulnerability. Elderly users report loneliness easing with robotic pets that \"respond\" to touch. The line between tool and deception blurs when profit drives design.\n\n\nLoneliness as a business model. Consent when the other party is code. The cost of treating humans like data points.",
