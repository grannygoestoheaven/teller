  "clean_story": "\"Facts are measurable. Opinions are beliefs. The word 'fact' comes from Latin, meaning 'something done. ' It’s something proven, like a math equation or a recorded event. \\n\\nWe often confuse facts and opinions, but they’re very different. A fact is like a ruler measuring a table’s length—it’s the same for everyone. An opinion is like saying, 'This table is beautiful,' which depends on personal taste. Facts can be tested and verified, while opinions can’t. \\n\\nFor example, saying 'The Earth orbits the Sun' is a fact, supported by science. But saying 'Space travel is exciting' is an opinion, because excitement is subjective. Even if many people agree on an opinion, it doesn’t make it a fact. \\n\\nFacts are the foundation of knowledge, while opinions shape how we interpret that knowledge. Both have their place, but mixing them up can lead to confusion. For instance, in a debate, facts help prove a point, while opinions add personal perspective. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how misinformation spreads, the role of evidence in science, and why personal beliefs matter in decision-making. \"",
