### Here's an example of the desired narration style : """absolutely everything you think about yourself and the universe could be an illusion as far as you know you are real and exist in a universe that was born 14 billion years ago and that gave rise to galaxies Stars the Earth and finally you except maybe not you may actually not exist for real but be the dream of a dead Universe you and everything you think exists crazy as it sounds this may be an unavoidable consequence of our best scientific theories about the universe okay this is a bit much let's start at the beginning we need to understand three concepts for this idea to make sense one the arrow of time what distinguishes the past from the future put a drop of red ink into a glass of water and you see the ink spread until it fills the container but never the opposite colored water where ink spontaneously concentrates and becomes a drop at the surface again time always seems to flow in the direction in which the ink spreads but if you take a microscope all you will see will be a swarm of molecules colliding at random there are no rules no forwards and backwards every individual motion that happens can occur in Reverse but we perceive a sort of Arrow of time that makes things happen in One Direction how does this phenomenon occur well this Arrow of time is not actually fundamental but a matter of probability when Inca molecules spread to fill a glass there are many different Slots of space they can occupy and therefore many different possibilities to combine them and just like your chances of winning the lottery grow the more tickets you have the probability that ink molecules will end up filling the glass is much higher than the probability that they'll concentrate in just one spot so it's not that the ink forming a drop again is forbidden by the laws of physics it's just extremely unlikely to see it you'd have to wait about 10 to the power of 106 billion years a one followed by 106 Dillion zeros if you had this much time to spare eventually by pure random chance you'd see a red blob form again actually with enough time you could see any shape forming like for example a small red soggy brain okay let's move on to idea 2. 2. the far future of the universe our universe was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang it expanded and evolved to give rise to the myriads of galaxies and things in other words the universe is kind of a glass of water with a lot of ink doing stuff it has an arrow of time that the universe is not a static class it seems to be getting bigger at an ever increasing speed because of dark energy basically everything in it is getting more and more diluted in about 100 trillion years the last star will die then a few interesting things will happen for the next few decillions vantilians and Googles of years eventually the universe will be a dark place fully dominated by dark energy a rapidly expanding ball of pure space almost devoid of matter you might think that this would lead to the ultimate death of everything but dark energy has one last surprise for you inner Universe dominated by dark energy space expands so dramatically that it creates a cosmic Horizon around you a border Beyond which nothing will ever be able to reach you not even light so for every practical purpose the universe has become a glass of finite size about 36 billion light years wide surrounded by an impassable Cosmic Horizon such a universe glass is basically a giant black hole turned inside out we know that due to Quantum effects all black holes emit a tiny amount of particles a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation and so does our inside out black hole in the end this radiation will fill the universe glass with particles again at this point so far in the future they're giving you a number has no more meaning we've reached the true final State the universe has now become a closed box full of particles at an extremely low but finite temperature and since they have a temperature they undergo random motions or in other words a glass filled with water and ink and an infinite amount of time ahead things are about to become interesting again three typing monkeys and fake universes eternity is a long long time so now even the most extremely unlikely things can happen the fluctuating particles are bumping into each other over and over and over again creating every combination of particles that's possible they're like a monkey typing at random on a typewriter almost all of the time it types gibberish but with enough time eventually it will write the first acts of Hamlet and with even more time the complete works of Eminem if ink in our universe glass generates any random Arrangements of particles what could they be well a spontaneous fluctuation could give rise to a planet or to a Galaxy or even to a lot of them so maybe our universe has already ended and all we see around us is a pop-up Universe not a universe that evolved from a big bang but one that fluctuated into existence by pure chance and that like the drop of ink will only exist for a while before dissolving again being random pop-up universes could be similar to ours but with funny glitches in some of these universes dinosaurs are riding snails in another stars are made of blueberries in another you're wearing a funny hat scientists in such universities wouldn't understand those glitches so maybe the greatest mysteries of physics are just nonsense bugs of our pop-up universe but not all possible fluctuations of our dead Universe have the same probability of occurring smaller fluctuations are much more probable than bigger ones a planet is more likely than a Galaxy but you know what's even way more likely a human brain are you actually just a brain you think therefore you exist but what else do you truly know in the end your brain is just interpreting signals from your senses and creating a world that you experience so technically you could be just your brain that thinks the world is real and if we follow the logic of the ink in the universe class in particular you could be a disembodied brain that just by chance emerged in a dead Universe with your complete set of knowledge and memories this is a pretty bizarre idea but if we do the maths it's kind of pretty solid let's compare the number of brains inside bodies in a living Universe with a number of naked brains in a dead Universe let's go really big and imagine that a total of 100 quadrillion humans will live around Earth and that the same amount of people will live around every star in the universe if we add this together we get about 10 to the power of 41 brains inside bodies that will exist however in a dead universe that has had enough time to explore all possible fluctuations and that will exist forever the number of naked brains that would emerge is well infinite so the probability that you're a floating brain is not only vastly larger than the probability that you're a real human it's so inconceivably larger that we can't even meaningfully quantify the difference how do you compare a number to Infinity so are you a floating brain that exists for One Moment In Time then basically forever passes and then you exist for another moment in time maybe not even in that order maybe your life happens backwards and you just don't notice maybe you've lived trillions of times already are you the dream of a dead universe really like ready wow probably not first of all there are a few loopholes for example Dark Energy could behave completely differently from what we think today and lead us to another future or maybe our dead universe will be too motionless to allow the creation of brains even with infinite time or maybe the universe will end up dying in another way our understanding of the cosmos doesn't have a solid enough foundation for anyone to worry if they're real or not loopholes aside if you were a fluctuating brain all the laws of physics stored in your brain would have originated at random and shouldn't bear any relation to the real world but we just used those laws to prove that you're a floating brain so even if you believe that you are a floating brain you'd have to admit that you have no good reason to believe that you are actually a floating brain okay so this hallucinatory trip might teach us something about our theories about the universe but in the end it's just a really weird exercise in what you can do with physics an exercise of what brains and bodies are able to think about so don't worry you're not a dream of the Dead Universe."""
