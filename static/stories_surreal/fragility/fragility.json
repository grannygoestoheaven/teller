  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Fragility is the quiet tremor beneath existence—a breath held too long, a spider’s web trembling under dew. It lives in the hollow between heartbeat and silence, where porcelain cracks whisper secrets to the floor. Even steel bends if you know its fatigue; even light fractures when stretched through prismatic grief.\n\nThe most delicate things are not always small: glaciers calve with a sigh, empires crumble in the time it takes to misplace a key. We mistake resilience for permanence, but fragility is the honest architecture of being—each scar a ledger of what barely held. To touch something fragile is to confess: I too am made of temporary things. The art is in the handling.",
