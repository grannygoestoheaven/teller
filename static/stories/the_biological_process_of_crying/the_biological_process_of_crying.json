  "clean_story": "Tears.  Lacrimal glands.  Emotional triggers.  The biological process of crying begins with the lacrimal glands, which are located above each eye.  These glands are responsible for producing tears, which are composed of water, salts, antibodies, and lysozyme.  When stimulated by various triggers, the lacrimal glands secrete tears into the eyes, providing lubrication and protection.  This process is not only a response to physical irritants but also to emotional stimuli, highlighting the complex interplay between the body's physiological and psychological systems.  Emotional crying is initiated by the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, which processes emotions and sends signals to the autonomic nervous system.  This system then activates the lacrimal glands to produce tears in response to emotions such as sadness, joy, or frustration.  The tears produced during emotional crying have a different chemical composition compared to those produced for lubrication, containing higher levels of stress hormones like adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  This suggests a potential role in stress relief and emotional regulation.  The act of crying also involves the facial muscles, particularly those around the eyes, which contract and cause the characteristic expression associated with crying.  This muscular activity can lead to the release of endorphins, which are natural painkillers, providing a sense of relief after crying.  Additionally, crying can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting a calming effect on the body.  These physiological responses highlight the multifaceted nature of crying as both a physical and emotional process.  Three related subjects are the role of crying in social bonding, the impact of crying on mental health, and the evolutionary significance of emotional tears.",
