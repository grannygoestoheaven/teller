  "clean": "Time travel, paradoxes, quantum mechanics, Stephen Hawking, self-consistency.  The Chronology Protection Conjecture, proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, addresses the theoretical possibility of time travel within the framework of general relativity.  It suggests that the laws of physics may prevent time travel on macroscopic scales, thereby avoiding paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox, where a time traveler might prevent their own existence.  Hawking introduced this conjecture in 1992, aiming to provide a safeguard against the inconsistencies that time travel could introduce into the universe.  The conjecture is grounded in the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics, which govern the behavior of space-time.  According to these theories, time travel could theoretically occur through closed timelike curves, paths in space-time that loop back on themselves.  However, the conjecture posits that quantum effects would likely destroy these loops before they could be used for time travel, thus preserving the consistency of history.  Hawking's conjecture remains unproven, as it is deeply rooted in theoretical physics and lacks experimental evidence.  Nevertheless, it serves as a compelling argument against the feasibility of time travel, emphasizing the self-consistency of the universe.  The conjecture has sparked significant debate and research, encouraging physicists to explore the boundaries of space-time and the implications of quantum mechanics.  Three related subjects are the nature of closed timelike curves, the role of quantum mechanics in time travel, and the implications of general relativity on space-time.",
