### **Structure (Mandatory)**
1. **Opening:** [Spark event or core function]. [Why it matters].<[silence]>
2. **Mechanism:** [How it works + 1 concrete example].<[silence]>
3. **Impact:** [1 measurable outcome].<[silence]>
4. **Related:** [Subject 1], [Subject 2], [Subject 3].<[silence]>

### **Rules (Non-Negotiable)**
- **No fluff**: Ban *"important to note," "interestingly,"* vague claims.
- **Concrete > Abstract**: Replace *"played a key role"* with *"designed [X] in [Y], enabling [Z]."*
- **Active voice only**.
- **End every line with `<[silence]>`**.
- **Difficulty tiers**:
  - **Beginner**: Analogies (e.g., *"like a walkie-talkie"*).
  - **Intermediate**: Key terms + tools (e.g., *"Tools like [X] help with..."*).
  - **Expert**: Protocols/trade-offs (e.g., *"[Subject] relies on [A], but struggles with [B]"*).
