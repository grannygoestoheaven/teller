    "clean_story": "Guitar as a chainsaw.  Music without borders. \"Frank Zappa\" wasn\u2019t just a name\u2014it was a warning label. Like slapping a \"high voltage\" sticker on a toaster, then plugging it into jazz, rock, and classical at once. Most hear \"composer\" and picture sheet music. Zappa\u2019s scores looked like blueprints for a Rube Goldberg machine\u2014precise, absurd, and guaranteed to collapse if you blinked. At 14, he turned his bedroom into a tape-loop lab, slicing RCA Victor 78s into collages. By 1966, Freak Out!\u2014his debut with The Mothers of Invention\u2014stuffed doo-wop, avant-garde noise, and political rants into one LP. Like serving a five-course meal in a fast-food wrapper. His guitar solos?Imagine a surgeon using a buzzsaw\u2014every note deliberate, every screech a calculated mess. On \"Willie the Pimp\" (1969), he bent strings like they owed him money, while the band swung between blues and chaos. Then there\u2019s 200 Motels (1971)\u2014a film/musical where nuns ride Harleys and orchestra players wear gas masks. Zappa called it \"a movie about touring that\u2019s as unpleasant as touring. \"He fought censorship (PMRC hearings, 1985), sued bootleggers, and released 62 albums in 30 years\u2014some recorded in his home studio, the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen. Three related subjects are tape music experiments, satirical protest songs, and how studios became instruments.",
