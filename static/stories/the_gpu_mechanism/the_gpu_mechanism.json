  "clean": "Parallel processing.  Thread execution.  Memory bandwidth.  The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) mechanism is a specialized electronic circuit designed to accelerate the rendering of images and videos.  Unlike Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are optimized for sequential processing, GPUs are built for parallel processing, allowing them to handle thousands of threads simultaneously.  This capability is achieved through a multitude of smaller cores that work together to perform complex computations efficiently.  Each core is less powerful than a CPU core, but the sheer number of cores allows GPUs to excel in tasks requiring massive parallelism.  Thread execution in GPUs is managed through a hierarchy of threads, blocks, and grids.  Threads are the smallest unit of execution, and they are grouped into blocks, which are then organized into grids.  This structure allows for efficient scheduling and execution of tasks, as the GPU can switch between threads with minimal overhead.  The architecture is designed to hide memory latency by keeping many threads in flight, ensuring that the GPU remains fully utilized even when some threads are waiting for data.  Memory bandwidth is a key factor in the performance of a GPU.  GPUs are equipped with high-bandwidth memory systems to quickly feed data to the cores.  The memory hierarchy typically includes global memory, shared memory, and registers, each with different access speeds and sizes.  Efficient use of these memory types is crucial for optimal performance, as it minimizes the time cores spend waiting for data.  Shared memory, in particular, allows threads within the same block to communicate quickly, further enhancing performance.  Three related subjects are GPU architecture evolution, GPU programming models, and GPU applications in machine learning.",
