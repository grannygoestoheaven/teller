  "clean_story": "Feudalism. Power through land. The word 'feudalism' comes from 'feud,' meaning a piece of land given in exchange for service. In medieval Europe, this system shaped society, where kings granted land to nobles, who in turn provided soldiers and protection. \\n\\nWe may usually believe that medieval Europe was just about knights and castles, but it was also a time of strict social rules. At the top were the kings, who owned all the land. They gave large pieces to nobles, called lords, who promised loyalty and military support. Lords then divided their land among knights and peasants, creating a pyramid of power. \\n\\nImagine a kingdom like a giant farm. The king owns the whole farm but lets his friends (the lords) manage parts of it. In return, these friends promise to help defend the farm and send soldiers when needed. The lords then let peasants work the land, giving them a place to live and protection in exchange for food and labor. \\n\\nThis system kept order but also created inequality. Peasants, or serfs, were tied to the land and couldn’t leave without permission. They worked long hours, growing crops and raising animals, while lords and knights lived in castles. Despite this, feudalism provided stability, as everyone had a role and knew what was expected of them. \\n\\nFeudalism wasn’t just about land; it was about loyalty and duty. If a lord failed to protect his people, they might switch allegiance to another lord. This system lasted for centuries, shaping laws, culture, and even language. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the rise of chivalry, the impact of the Black Death on feudalism, and how medieval trade challenged the feudal system.",
