  "clean_story": "\"Mental discomfort. Conflict resolution. The term 'cognitive dissonance' comes from 'cognition,' meaning thinking, and 'dissonance,' meaning conflict. It describes the mental tension that happens when your beliefs and actions don’t match. Imagine you believe smoking is bad for you, but you still smoke. That uncomfortable feeling you get is cognitive dissonance. It’s like having two conflicting thoughts fighting in your head, making you uneasy. Cognitive dissonance isn’t just about small things like eating junk food when you know it’s unhealthy. It can also explain bigger behaviors, like someone who supports animal rights but still eats meat. The discomfort can be so strong that people change their beliefs or actions to reduce it. For example, a smoker might start believing that the health risks are exaggerated to feel better about their habit. This concept was first studied by psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1950s. He noticed that people often change their attitudes to match their behavior, rather than the other way around. This helps explain why people might stick to their opinions even when faced with evidence that contradicts them. It’s a way of protecting their self-image and reducing mental stress. Cognitive dissonance isn’t always bad. It can motivate people to make positive changes, like quitting smoking or adopting healthier habits. But it can also lead to stubbornness and resistance to new ideas. Understanding this concept can help us recognize when we’re rationalizing our actions and encourage us to think more critically. \"",
