  "clean_story": "Network protocols. Information retrieval. The creation of the URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, traces back to the early 1990s when Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, sought to devise a system for accessing resources across the nascent World Wide Web. His objective was to create a standardized method for identifying and locating digital resources on the internet. Berners-Lee's work at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, provided the backdrop for this development. The URL was part of a broader initiative to establish a universal protocol for data exchange, which also included HTTP and HTML. The URL's structure was meticulously designed to facilitate the retrieval of information. It consists of several components, including the protocol (such as HTTP), the domain name, and the path to the specific resource. This structure allows users to access diverse types of content, from web pages to multimedia files, by specifying the location and method of retrieval. The URL's format has remained largely unchanged since its inception, underscoring its robustness and adaptability. The introduction of the URL significantly impacted the accessibility and organization of information on the internet. By providing a consistent way to locate resources, URLs enabled the seamless linking of documents and the creation of a vast, interconnected web of information. This innovation laid the groundwork for the development of search engines and browsers, which further enhanced the user experience by simplifying navigation. The URL's role in the evolution of the internet is a testament to its enduring relevance. As the internet continues to evolve, the URL remains a vital component of web architecture. Despite the emergence of new technologies and protocols, the basic principles underlying the URL persist, ensuring its continued utility. Its creation marked a pivotal moment in the history of the internet, facilitating the global exchange of knowledge and ideas. Three related subjects are domain name system, HTTP protocol, and web browsers.",
