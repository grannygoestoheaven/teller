  "clean_story": "\"Perception shifts. Reality remains. The term 'perception' derives from the Latin 'perceptio,' meaning 'receiving or collecting. ' Reality, from 'realis,' denotes the state of things as they actually exist. \\n\\nPeople often perceive optical illusions as reality, yet they reveal the brain's interpretation rather than the truth. For instance, the Müller-Lyer illusion tricks the mind into seeing lines of different lengths due to arrow-like ends, though they are identical. This demonstrates how perception can diverge from physical reality. \\n\\nIn technology, augmented reality (AR) overlays digital information onto the real world, altering perception without changing reality. Pokémon GO, a popular AR game, places virtual creatures in real environments, blending the digital with the tangible. This creates an immersive experience where perception is manipulated to enhance engagement. \\n\\nPerception vs. reality also plays a role in eyewitness testimony, where memory can be influenced by stress or suggestion, leading to inaccuracies.
