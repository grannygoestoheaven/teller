  "clean_story": "Hardened fingertip shields.  Tools for precision and grip. \"Nail\" traces back to Old English nægl, meaning \"metal pin\"—fitting, since nails act like the body’s built-in pins, anchoring skin to bone while doubling as micro-tools. Most see them as dead keratin—like a hair that stopped growing—but the matrix beneath the cuticle is alive, pushing cells forward at 3 millimeters per month. Faster on your dominant hand. Slower in winter. Their real trick? Leverage. Press a nail against wood, and the hard plate spreads force across the fingertip, letting you pry open a soda can or scrape off a sticker without crushing soft tissue. Try that with a padded glove—it’s like using a marshmallow as a screwdriver. The whitish half-moon (lunula) marks where new cells form. Damage it, and the nail grows back ridged or split—proof that even small injuries leave blueprints. Animals use claws for the same physics:A squirrel’s nails hook bark like a climber’s pitons. A mole’s broad nails shovel dirt like tiny bulldozers. Human nails betray habits:Vertical ridges signal dehydration. Horizontal lines (Beau’s lines) mark a fever or crash diet months prior. Doctors check them like tree rings for stress. Three related subjects are keratin’s other roles, how primates use nails differently, and what fingernails reveal about health.",
