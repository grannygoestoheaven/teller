  "clean_story": "**Words as tools. Power with responsibility.**\n\n*\"Linguistic research\"* studies how language works—its sounds, rules, and how people use it. The \"ethics\" part asks: *How do we study language without harming the people who speak it?*\n\nResearchers once treated languages like specimens—recording words, grammar, or stories without asking speakers’ permission. Some even stole sacred songs or rituals, publishing them as \"data.\" Today, ethics demand **consent, respect, and fairness**. For example:\n- **The *Havasupai case*** (2004): Arizona State University researchers took blood samples from the Havasupai Tribe to study diabetes but later used the DNA for unrelated genetic research—**without permission**. The tribe sued and won. Linguists now know: *Even a recorded word can be misused.*\n- **Endangered languages**: If a researcher documents a dying language but locks the data in a university archive, the community loses access to their own heritage. Ethical work **returns recordings, dictionaries, or lessons** to speakers first.\n\n**Key rules now**:\n1. **Informed consent**: Explain *exactly* how recordings/data will be used. No surprises.\n2. **Benefit sharing**: If research helps a company (e.g., AI voice assistants), the language community should gain too—like funding for schools.\n3. **Anonymity**: Protect identities. A misquoted proverb could spark conflicts in small communities.\n\n**Why it matters**: Language isn’t just data—it’s identity. A misused word can erase history; a shared story can revive it.\n\n*Curiosity hooks*: **language extinction** | **AI trained on stolen speech** | **how sign languages challenge \"written consent\"**",
