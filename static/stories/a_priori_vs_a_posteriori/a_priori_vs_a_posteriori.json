  "clean_story": "\"A priori knowledge. A posteriori understanding. The terms 'a priori' and 'a posteriori' originate from Latin, meaning 'from the earlier' and 'from the latter,' respectively. A priori refers to knowledge that is independent of experience, like mathematical truths, while a posteriori relies on empirical evidence, such as scientific observations. \\n\\nConsider the statement 'all bachelors are unmarried. ' This is a priori because it’s true by definition, requiring no external validation. In contrast, 'water boils at 100°C at sea level' is a posteriori, as it depends on experimental verification. These concepts are crucial in philosophy and science, shaping how we validate knowledge and understand the world. \\n\\nA vivid example is Einstein’s theory of relativity. Initially, it was a priori, based on mathematical reasoning. However, it became a posteriori when experiments confirmed its predictions, like the bending of light around the sun. \\n\\nThe trade-off between these types of knowledge involves certainty versus empirical validation. A priori offers logical certainty but may lack real-world applicability, while a posteriori provides practical insights but can be fallible. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the philosophy of science, the nature of truth, and the evolution of scientific theories. \"",
