  "clean_story": "\"Words as art. Emotions in rhythm. The word 'poetry' comes from the Greek word *poiesis*, meaning 'to make. ' It’s like crafting a song with words, where each line is a brushstroke on a canvas of feelings. \\n Poetry isn’t just about rhyming or counting syllables. It’s about capturing moments, ideas, and emotions in a way that makes them feel alive. Think of it like a snapshot of a thought, frozen in time but full of movement. \\n For example, a poem might describe the sound of rain not just as 'drops falling,' but as 'whispers from the sky,' making you hear and feel it differently. This is the power of poetry—it turns ordinary things into something extraordinary by using vivid language and rhythm. \\n Poems can be short, like a haiku with just 17 syllables, or long, like an epic story spanning pages. They can be serious, funny, or even nonsensical, depending on what the poet wants to express. Some poems follow strict rules, while others break all the rules, showing that creativity has no limits. \\n One famous example is Edgar Allan Poe’s 'The Raven,' which uses repetition and eerie imagery to create a haunting atmosphere. Another is Maya Angelou’s 'Still I Rise,' which celebrates resilience and strength through powerful, uplifting words. \\n Poetry isn’t just for reading—it’s for feeling. It can make you laugh, cry, or think deeply about life. Whether it’s a love poem, a nature poem, or a poem about everyday struggles, it connects us to our emotions and the world around us. \\n So next time you read a poem, don’t just read the words—listen to the rhythm, feel the emotions, and let your imagination soar. \\n .",
