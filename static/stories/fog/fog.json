  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Fog is the breath of the earth holding its secrets close—a veil of suspended time where edges blur and the world dissolves into milk and shadow. It creeps on silent feet, erasing horizons, turning familiar streets into labyrinths of ghostly suggestion. Lamplight bleeds into it like watercolor, smudged and ephemeral, while sounds muffle as if wrapped in cotton. The fog does not announce itself; it simply is, a quiet conspiracy between moisture and stillness, softening the sharp angles of reality.\n\nIn its embrace, distance becomes a myth. A figure ten paces away might as well be a memory, their form reduced to a smudge of intention. The air grows thick with the scent of damp wool and old books, the cold seeping into bones like a slow confession. Fog is neither friend nor foe—it is the great indifferent, a canvas for projection: loneliness for the solitary walker, mystery for the poet, a pause button for the weary. When it lifts, it leaves no trace, only the faintest impression that something was there, watching. Waiting. Then gone.",
