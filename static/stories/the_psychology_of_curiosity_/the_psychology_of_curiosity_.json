  "clean_story": "\"Why we ask. How questions drive us. \"\n\n\nThe word curiosity comes from Latin curiosus—meaning \"careful\" or \"eager to know. \" It’s the mental itch that makes you turn over a rock, click a link, or ask \"What if?\"\n\n\nWe often think of curiosity as just a thirst for answers. But studies show it’s closer to a reward system hack. When your brain expects new information, it releases dopamine—the same chemical tied to food or winning a game. Example: A 2014 study had people guess trivia answers. Their brains lit up more when they were about to learn the answer than when they actually got it. The anticipation was the high.\n\n\nCuriosity isn’t random. It follows a pattern:\n1. Spot a gap (e. g. , \"Why is the sky blue?\").\n2. Feel the tension (your brain dislikes unfinished puzzles).\n3. Seek the missing piece (Google, experiments, or just staring at the sky).\n\n\nThis loop explains why mystery hooks us. Cliffhangers in stories, unopened gifts, even the \"90% of shipwrecks remain undiscovered\" fact—all exploit this. Kids ask ~300 questions a day. Adults ask fewer, but the mechanism stays. The difference? Adults learn to ignore gaps—or call them \"not important. \"\n\n\nToo much curiosity can backfire. The \"curiosity killed the cat\" warning holds weight: A 2018 experiment found people would risk electric shocks just to satisfy curiosity about neutral images. The drive to know can override self-preservation.\n\n\nMemory’s role. You remember answers to questions you wanted to ask 40% better than random facts. Curiosity primes your brain like a sponge.\n\n\nThe flip side: boredom. No gaps to fill? Your brain invents them—daydreaming, f",
