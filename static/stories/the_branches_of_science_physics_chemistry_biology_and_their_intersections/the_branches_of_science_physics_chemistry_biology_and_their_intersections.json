  "clean_story": "Physics. Chemistry. Biology. The three pillars of science. Physics studies forces and energy, chemistry explores how substances interact, and biology examines living things. Together, they form a powerful trio that helps us understand the world. Imagine physics as the rules of a game, chemistry as the players and their strategies, and biology as the story of life unfolding on the field. Each branch has its own focus, but they often overlap in fascinating ways. For example, physics explains how light behaves, chemistry tells us how atoms in a plant use that light to grow, and biology shows how that plant becomes part of an ecosystem. These connections help scientists solve complex problems, like developing new medicines or understanding climate change. Three related subjects are the history of scientific discovery, the ethics of genetic engineering, and the future of renewable energy.",
