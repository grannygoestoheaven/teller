  "clean_story": "Words shifting places. Meaning stays the same. \"Prepositional flexibility\" describes how some words can swap spots with their prepositions—yet the sentence still makes sense. Like flipping \"turn on the light\" to \"turn the light on\" without breaking the rule. Most languages lock prepositions in place—like glue. English lets them float. Try it:\"Pick up your keys\" or \"Pick your keys up. \"Both work. But not all prepositions bend. \"Look at the stars\" sounds right—\"Look the stars at\" does not. Only certain verbs (phrasal verbs) allow this trick. Examples:\"Throw away the trash\" ↔ \"Throw the trash away. \"\n\"Turn off the TV\" ↔ \"Turn the TV off. \"Why does this matter?It shows how English prioritizes rhythm over rigid rules. Poets and songwriters exploit this to fit lyrics. Non-native speakers often trip here—memories of \"why can’t I say that?\"Three related subjects are phrasal verb patterns, syntax in music lyrics, and how languages resist flexibility.",
