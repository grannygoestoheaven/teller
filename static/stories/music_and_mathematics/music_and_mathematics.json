  "clean_story": "\"Patterns in sound. Mathematics defines them. The term 'music and mathematics' refers to the deep connection between musical structures and mathematical principles. It’s like translating emotions into equations. Music relies on mathematical concepts like ratios, frequencies, and patterns. For example, the notes in a scale follow precise frequency ratios, like the octave, which doubles the frequency of the starting note. This creates harmony, where notes sound pleasing together because their frequencies align mathematically. Composers like Bach used mathematical structures in their music. His *The Art of Fugue* is a famous example, where themes are inverted and mirrored, much like solving an equation. Even the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers where each is the sum of the two before it, appears in musical compositions, creating a sense of balance and progression. Mathematics also helps in tuning instruments. The equal temperament tuning system divides the octave into 12 equal parts, ensuring that music sounds consistent across different keys. Without this mathematical precision, instruments would clash when playing together. Three related subjects are the science of sound waves, how algorithms create music, and the history of musical scales. \"",
