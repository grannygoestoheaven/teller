  "clean_story": "Knowledge. The understanding of facts. The word 'knowledge' comes from the Old English 'cnāwleċe,' meaning 'acknowledged, known. ' It refers to information, skills, or insights gained through experience, education, or observation. Knowledge is often seen as the foundation of wisdom and the key to solving problems. But what makes knowledge reliable? It’s not just about having information—it’s about knowing how to use it. For example, a chef doesn’t just know recipes; they understand how flavors interact and how to adapt them. Similarly, a scientist doesn’t just memorize formulas; they know how to apply them to new discoveries. Knowledge can be explicit, like facts in a textbook, or tacit, like the intuition a doctor gains from years of practice. It can be shared through language, demonstrations, or even art. But knowledge isn’t static—it evolves as new evidence emerges and old ideas are challenged. This is why science, for instance, relies on peer review and experimentation to refine what we know. Three related subjects are the philosophy of truth, the role of intuition in decision-making, and how technology is changing the way we access and verify information.",
