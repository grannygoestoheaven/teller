Imagine a flowchart where circles are events, rectangles are conditions, and arrows connect them. Tokens flow through this network, triggering events and updating conditions. It's like a game of dominoes, where each tile falling knocks over the next. In a real-world example, a vending machine: when you insert money (token), it triggers the selection process (event), which updates the inventory (condition).
