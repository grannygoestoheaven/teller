  "clean_story": "Tidal locking.  Habitable zones.  Gravitational interactions.  Exomoons are natural satellites that orbit exoplanets, planets outside our solar system.  The detection of exomoons is a developing field of study, primarily due to the challenges posed by their small size and the vast distances involved.  While thousands of exoplanets have been confirmed, exomoons remain elusive, with only a few candidates identified.  The methods used to detect them often involve observing the subtle effects they have on their host planets, such as transit timing variations.  The potential habitability of exomoons is a subject of considerable interest.  Some exomoons could reside within the habitable zone of their star, where conditions might support liquid water.  Tidal forces exerted by their host planets could generate internal heat, potentially creating environments conducive to life.  This internal heating might allow for subsurface oceans, similar to those hypothesized on moons like Europa in our own solar system.  Gravitational interactions between exomoons and their host planets can offer insights into their formation and evolution.  These interactions can affect the orbital dynamics and stability of both the exomoons and their planets.  Studying these dynamics helps astronomers understand the complex processes that govern planetary systems.  The presence of exomoons can also influence the atmospheric properties of their host planets, offering additional avenues for research.  The search for exomoons continues to push the boundaries of astronomical observation.  Advances in technology and methodology are gradually improving the chances of detecting these elusive bodies.  As the field progresses, exomoons may provide valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of planetary systems beyond our own.  Three related subjects are the study of exoplanet atmospheres, the search for extraterrestrial life, and the investigation of tidal heating effects.",
