  "clean": "Uncertainty quantification, kernel functions, non-parametric models.\n\n The Gaussian Process is a powerful tool in the realm of machine learning, particularly known for its capability to model uncertainty in predictions.  It is a non-parametric model, meaning it does not assume a fixed form for the underlying function it aims to learn.  Instead, it infers the function directly from the data, providing a flexible approach to regression and classification tasks.   At the heart of the Gaussian Process is the concept of kernel functions.  These functions define the similarity between data points, allowing the process to make predictions based on observed data.  The choice of kernel can significantly influence the performance of the Gaussian Process, as it encodes assumptions about the function's smoothness and periodicity.  Commonly used kernels include the Radial Basis Function and the Matérn kernel.   A notable aspect of Gaussian Processes is their ability to provide uncertainty estimates alongside predictions.  This feature is particularly valuable in applications where understanding the confidence of predictions is important.  By modeling the distribution over possible functions that fit the data, Gaussian Processes offer a probabilistic framework that quantifies uncertainty in a natural way.   Despite their advantages, Gaussian Processes can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets, due to their reliance on matrix operations.  Various approximation techniques, such as sparse Gaussian Processes, have been developed to address this limitation.
