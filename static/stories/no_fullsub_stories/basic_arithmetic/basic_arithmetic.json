  "clean_story": "Numbers. Counting, adding, subtracting. The word 'arithmetic' comes from the Greek word 'arithmos,' meaning 'number. ' It’s the foundation of math, helping us solve everyday problems like splitting a pizza or calculating change. Imagine you’re at a store buying three apples that cost $1 each. You give the cashier $5, and they give you $2 back. That’s subtraction in action—$5 minus $3 equals $2. Or think about adding up the total cost of your groceries: $2 for bread, $3 for milk, and $1 for eggs. That’s $6 in total. Arithmetic is everywhere, from cooking to shopping, making sure we get things right. It’s not just about numbers on paper. It’s about understanding how things add up in real life, like figuring out how much time you have left before your favorite show starts or how many steps you need to take to reach your goal. Without arithmetic, we’d be lost in a world of guesses and mistakes. Three related subjects are the history of math, how algorithms work, and the role of numbers in nature.",
