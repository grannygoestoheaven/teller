  "clean_story": "Storing without thinking. Recalling without trying. \"Memory\" comes from the Latin memoria—the mind’s ability to hold onto moments, facts, or skills, then pull them back like a fisherman reeling in a net. Most see it as a vault, locking away birthdays or faces. But memory is closer to a library where the books rewrite themselves—every recall tweaks the original. Here’s the mechanism:Neurons, brain cells, talk by firing electric spikes. When two neurons chat often, their connection strengthens—like a path in tall grass becoming a dirt road, then a highway. This is long-term potentiation, the brain’s way of bookmarking \"important\" routes. Example:Smell fresh-baked bread. —Your brain might flash to Grandma’s kitchen. That’s your hippocampus, the brain’s librarian, linking scent to a decades-old memory file. But here’s the twist:Each recall adds new details—maybe the bread was rye, not sourdough. The memory updates, quietly editing the past. Precision matters:A 2014 study showed people remembering a fake event—like a hot-air balloon ride—after seeing doctored photos. Their brains stitched false threads into real ones, no warning given. Three related subjects are false memory experiments, how sleep reshapes memories, and why some forget on purpose.",
