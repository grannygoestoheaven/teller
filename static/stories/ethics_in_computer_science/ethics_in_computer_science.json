  "clean_story": "\"Right and wrong in tech. Ethics guides decisions. The term 'ethics' comes from the Greek word 'ethos,' meaning character or moral principles. In computer science, ethics is about making choices that consider fairness, privacy, and responsibility. Imagine you’re building a game where players can buy items with real money. Is it fair if some players can afford more than others? Ethics helps answer these questions. Ethics in computer science isn’t just about following rules—it’s about thinking ahead. For example, when designing an app that collects user data, ethical considerations include how to protect that data and whether users are aware of what’s being collected. A famous case is the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where personal data was used without consent, leading to stricter privacy laws like GDPR. Another key area is artificial intelligence. AI systems learn from data, and if that data is biased, the AI’s decisions can be unfair. For instance, a hiring algorithm trained on mostly male resumes might favor male candidates, reinforcing gender bias. Ethical AI design involves checking for these biases and ensuring fairness. Ethics also plays a role in cybersecurity. Hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain act unethically, while ethical hackers help companies fix security flaws before they’re exploited. This distinction shows how ethics shapes behavior in the tech world. Ultimately, ethics in computer science is about balancing innovation with responsibility. It’s not just about what we can build, but what we should build—and how it affects people.",
