Sleep\u2019s hidden workshop. \"Dreaming\" comes from the Old English dr\u0113am, meaning both \"joyful music\" and \"vision seen in sleep\"\u2014like your mind composing a silent symphony while the body rests. Most assume dreams are just random noise\u2014but they\u2019re more like a nightshift data cleanup. Your brain replays daily experiences, trims useless details,  and stitches memories into long-term storage. Here\u2019s the mechanism:During REM sleep, your brain\u2019s visual cortex lights up like a projector,  while the prefrontal cortex\u2014the \"logic manager\"\u2014goes offline. That\u2019s why dreams feel real but make no sense:your inner director is asleep at the wheel. Take lucid dreaming\u2014where people realize they\u2019re dreaming and sometimes control the plot. Studies show it activates the same brain areas as waking self-awareness,  proving consciousness isn\u2019t tied to open eyes. Even animals dream. Rats replay maze routes in their sleep,  and dogs twitch as if chasing phantom squirrels. Their brains follow the same REM patterns as ours. Three related subjects are sleep paralysis mechanics, how blind people dream, and why we forget 90% of dreams.", "timestamp": "20260301T102330Z"}
