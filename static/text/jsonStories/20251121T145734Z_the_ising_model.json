The Ising Model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism, was introduced by Wilhelm Lenz and further developed by his student Ernst Ising in the early 20th century.  It represents magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be in one of two states, often denoted as up or down.  These spins are arranged on a lattice, allowing for interactions between neighboring spins.  The model's simplicity makes it a valuable tool for understanding phase transitions, particularly in two-dimensional systems.  In its simplest form, the Ising Model considers a one-dimensional lattice where each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbors.  The energy of the system is determined by the alignment or misalignment of spins, with a preference for aligned spins, which minimizes energy.  Despite its simplicity, the one-dimensional model does not exhibit a phase transition at non-zero temperature.  However, the two-dimensional Ising Model, solved exactly by Lars Onsager in 1944, does show a phase transition, offering insights into critical phenomena.  The Ising Model has been extended to more complex systems, including three-dimensional lattices and models with additional interactions.  These extensions help in studying more realistic magnetic systems and contribute to the broader field of statistical mechanics.  Computational techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations, are often employed to explore these extended models, providing numerical solutions where analytical ones are challenging.
