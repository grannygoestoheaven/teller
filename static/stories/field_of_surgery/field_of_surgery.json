  "tagged_story_for_tts": "**Cutting to heal. Hands that mend.**\n\nThe word *surgery* comes from the Greek *cheirourgia*—*cheir* (hand) and *ergon* (work). It means \"working with hands,\" and that’s exactly what surgeons do: fix what’s broken inside the body, not with magic, but with tools, skill, and precision.\n\nMost people think of surgery as dramatic—scalpels slicing, alarms beeping, a race against time. But the real work is quieter, almost invisible. Before the first cut, surgeons study scans like architects reading blueprints. They plan where to enter, what to avoid (a nerve here, a blood vessel there), and how to rebuild. The body isn’t a puzzle with identical pieces; every liver, bone, or heart has its own shape, scars, and quirks. A surgeon’s hands must adapt, like a locksmith picking a unique lock—except the lock is alive, bleeding, and fighting back.\n\nTake a broken bone. If it’s a clean snap, a metal plate and screws (like tiny Lego bricks) hold it together while it knits back. But if the bone shatters like glass? Surgeons piece it together like a 3D jigsaw, sometimes using bone grafts—borrowed from the patient’s hip or a donor—to fill gaps. Or consider a heart bypass: a surgeon takes a vein from the leg, sews one end above a clogged artery, the other end below it, and *reroutes* blood flow like detouring traffic around a blocked road. The tools are simple in idea—a needle, thread, clamps—but the stakes are measured in millimeters and seconds.\n\nThe hardest part isn’t the cutting. It’s the *not* cutting. A great surgeon knows when to stop, when to leave well enough alone. Every snip risks damage; every stitch must hold but not strangle. And after? The body does the real work: cells rush to the wound like repair crews, knitting skin, bone, or muscle back together. Surgery just gives them a fighting chance.\n\nWhat about the hands that can’t reach—like a tumor wrapped around a spine? Or the cuts too tiny for human fingers? Or the day when robots don’t just assist, but operate alone? And how do you train for a job where every mistake is permanent?",
