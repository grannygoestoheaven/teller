Ball over a net.**\n\nThe word *tennis* comes from the French *tenez*—meaning \"take this!\" or \"hold!\"—a shout players used when serving in its early 12th-century handball version.\n\nTennis looks like a graceful dance: players glide, leap, and strike with precision. But beneath the elegance lies a physics battle. The court is a 78-foot battlefield where angles, spin, and timing decide victory. A serve isn’t just a hit—it’s a calculated launch. Top players like Serena Williams or Novak Djokovic don’t just swing; they manipulate the ball’s rotation to curve it (*topspin* for dipping shots, *slice* for skidding low bounces) or flatten it into a 130 mph bullet. The net, just 3 feet high, forces strategy: lobs arc over opponents, while drop shots die inches past it.\n\nMatches unfold in points that climb oddly—15, 30, 40—then \"game.\" Win six games (with a two-game lead), and you take a *set*. Best of three or five sets wins the match. Tie at 6-6? A *tiebreak* condenses the tension: first to seven points (with a two-point lead) survives.\n\nGrass courts (Wimbledon) reward fast, low bounces. Clay (Roland Garros) slows the ball, extending rallies into marathons. Hard courts (US Open) split the difference. Each surface demands a different weapon: Roger Federer’s slicing serve-and-volley dominated grass, while Rafael Nadal’s relentless topspin grinding crushed clay.\n\nThe margin between winner and loser? Millimeters. A ball clipped 1mm too high on a 120 mph serve might land out. Hawk-Eye cameras now track these near-misses at 340 frames per second, settling disputes in an instant.\n\nSpeed versus endurance. Geometry versus instinct. A sport where a single misstep—or a perfectly placed shot—can shift momentum in seconds.\n\nWhat about the science of spin. The evolution of rackets from wood to carbon fiber.
