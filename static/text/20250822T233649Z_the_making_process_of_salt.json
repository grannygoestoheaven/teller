  "clean": "Evaporation.  Crystallization.  Harvesting.  Purification.  The making process of salt begins with the evaporation of seawater or brine from salt mines.  In coastal areas, seawater is collected in large, shallow ponds where it is left to evaporate naturally under the sun and wind.  This process can take several weeks, during which the water gradually diminishes, leaving behind concentrated saline solutions.  In contrast, salt mines extract brine from underground deposits, which is then pumped to the surface for further processing.  Once the water has evaporated, the next stage is crystallization.  As the concentration of salt increases, crystals begin to form and settle at the bottom of the evaporation ponds.  These crystals are carefully monitored and harvested at the right time to ensure quality and consistency.  In the case of mined salt, the brine is heated in large pans to accelerate evaporation, resulting in the formation of salt crystals.  Harvesting involves collecting the salt crystals from the evaporation ponds or pans.  Workers use specialized tools to gather the salt, which is then washed to remove impurities.  This washing process is crucial to ensure that the final product is clean and suitable for consumption.  The salt is then dried and sometimes ground to achieve the desired texture and size.  Purification is the final step, where any remaining impurities are removed to produce high-quality salt.  This may involve additional washing, drying, and sometimes iodization, depending on the intended use.  The resulting salt is then packaged and distributed for various applications, from culinary uses to industrial purposes.  Three related subjects are the history of salt trade, the environmental impact of salt production, and the nutritional differences between salt types.",
