  "clean": "Cognitive dissonance.  Confirmation bias.  Social influence.  The psychology of belief examines how individuals form, maintain, and sometimes change their beliefs.  Cognitive dissonance plays a significant role in this process.  When people encounter information that contradicts their beliefs, they experience discomfort, which often leads them to reject or rationalize the conflicting data.  This mechanism helps maintain a consistent worldview, even when faced with opposing evidence.  Confirmation bias further influences belief formation by causing individuals to favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.  This bias affects how people seek out, interpret, and remember information, often leading to a skewed understanding of reality.  It reinforces existing beliefs and can make changing one's perspective challenging.  As a result, individuals may become more entrenched in their views, regardless of the evidence presented to them.  Social influence also plays a pivotal role in shaping beliefs.  Humans are inherently social creatures, and the opinions and behaviors of others can significantly impact individual beliefs.  Group dynamics, such as conformity and peer pressure, can lead individuals to adopt beliefs that align with their social circles.  This influence can be powerful, as belonging to a group often provides a sense of identity and security.
