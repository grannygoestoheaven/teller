  "clean_story": "\"Clean energy. Smart roads. The future of transportation is electric and autonomous. Electric vehicles (EVs) run on batteries instead of gas, reducing pollution. Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, use sensors and AI to navigate without a driver. Together, they promise safer, greener, and more efficient travel. Imagine a world where your car charges while you sleep, using energy from solar panels on your roof. Or picture a highway where cars communicate with each other, avoiding accidents and traffic jams. These aren’t just dreams—they’re the goals of modern transportation technology. EVs are already here, with brands like Tesla leading the way. They’re quieter, cheaper to run, and produce zero emissions, making cities cleaner. Autonomous vehicles are still in development, but companies like Waymo are testing them on public roads. These cars use cameras, radar, and AI to 'see' and react to their surroundings, just like a human driver—but with fewer mistakes. The future isn’t just about cars, though. Electric buses, bikes, and even flying taxis are being explored. Smart roads with sensors could charge EVs wirelessly or adjust traffic lights to ease congestion. The challenge? Building infrastructure to support these changes and ensuring safety. But the potential is huge: less pollution, fewer accidents, and more time for passengers to relax or work during their commute. Three related subjects are how AI improves safety, the environmental impact of EVs, and the rise of smart cities. \"",
