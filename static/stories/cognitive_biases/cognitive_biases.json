  "clean_story": "Cognitive biases. Mental shortcuts. The term 'cognitive bias' comes from 'cognize,' meaning to know or perceive, and 'bias,' meaning a leaning or preference. It refers to the systematic patterns in our thinking that lead us to make errors in judgment. Imagine you’re trying to solve a puzzle, but your brain keeps suggesting pieces that don’t quite fit. That’s a cognitive bias in action. These biases are like mental shortcuts our brains use to process information quickly, but they can sometimes lead us astray. For example, the 'confirmation bias' is when we only pay attention to information that supports what we already believe, ignoring anything that contradicts it. It’s like only reading reviews that match your opinion before buying something, while dismissing all the negative ones. Another common bias is the 'availability heuristic,' where we judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall examples of it. If you’ve recently heard about a plane crash, you might overestimate the chances of another one happening soon, even though statistically, plane travel is very safe. These biases can affect our decisions in many areas of life, from personal relationships to financial investments. Understanding them can help us make more informed choices and avoid common pitfalls. Three related subjects are how our brains process information, the psychology behind decision-making, and the impact of media on our perceptions. \"",
