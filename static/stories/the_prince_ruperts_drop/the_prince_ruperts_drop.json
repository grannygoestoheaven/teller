  "clean": "Tensile stress.  Thermal shock.\n\nThe Prince Rupert's Drop is a glass object formed by dripping molten glass into cold water.  This rapid cooling process creates a teardrop-shaped structure with unique mechanical properties.  The drop's bulbous end can withstand a significant amount of force without breaking, demonstrating remarkable strength.  However, its tail is highly fragile and, when broken, causes the entire structure to shatter explosively.  The strength of the bulbous end is attributed to the internal compressive stresses formed during the rapid cooling process.  As the outer layer of the glass solidifies first, it contracts and exerts compressive forces on the inner layers.  These forces create a balance that enhances the drop's resilience to external pressure.  The drop's fragility at the tail is due to the lack of compressive stress, making it susceptible to breakage.  The explosive shattering of the Prince Rupert's Drop is a result of the stored energy within the compressive stresses.  When the tail is damaged, the balance is disrupted, releasing the stored energy and causing the drop to disintegrate.  This phenomenon illustrates the interplay between tensile and compressive forces within the glass structure.  The drop's behavior provides insight into material science and stress distribution.  The Prince Rupert's Drop has intrigued scientists for centuries due to its peculiar properties.  It serves as a fascinating example of how material properties can be manipulated through manufacturing processes.  The study of these drops contributes to a broader understanding of glass and its applications.  Three related subjects are the study of tempered glass, the behavior of stress in materials, and the principles of rapid cooling in manufacturing.",
