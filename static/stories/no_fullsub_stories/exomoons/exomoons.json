  "clean_story": "Exomoons' atmospheres.  Tidal heating.  Exomoons, natural satellites orbiting planets outside our solar system, present intriguing possibilities for study.  Their atmospheres, if present, could offer insights into their composition and potential habitability.  Detecting these atmospheres involves observing subtle changes in light as the exomoon passes in front of its host star.  This method, known as transit spectroscopy, requires precise instruments and careful analysis.  Tidal heating, a process where gravitational forces generate heat within a moon, can significantly affect an exomoon's environment.  This internal heating might sustain liquid water beneath icy surfaces, creating conditions that could support life.  Understanding tidal heating's impact on exomoons helps scientists assess their potential for hosting life.  The search for exomoons is challenging due to their small size and faint signals.  Advanced telescopes and techniques are essential for detecting these distant objects.  As technology progresses, the discovery of more exomoons will enhance our understanding of planetary systems.
