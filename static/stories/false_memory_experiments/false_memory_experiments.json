  "clean_story": "Remembering what never happened. Tricking the mind’s filing cabinet.\n\"False memory\" means recalling events that didn’t occur—or recalling them wrong—yet feeling certain they’re real. Like misplacing your keys and swearing you left them on the counter, only to find them in your pocket. Now imagine scientists planting that wrong memory on purpose.\n\nExperiments prove how easily memories bend. In the 1990s, psychologist Elizabeth Loftus showed people fake ads for Disneyland—one with a cartoon rabbit named \"Bugs Bunny\" (who’s Warner Bros. , not Disney). Later, 16% of participants insisted they’d met Bugs at the park. Their brains filled gaps with plausible details, like a child’s drawing colored outside the lines.\n\nHere’s how it works:Researchers use misinformation (e. g. , \"The thief had a mustache—right?\") or guided imagery (\"Picture the red car speeding away…\"). Repeat the suggestion. Add emotional hooks (\"How scared were you when the clown popped out?\"). Soon, the brain stitches the lie into memory, indistinguishable from truth.\n\nOne famous test: the \"lost in a mall\" study. Families were told a fake story about their child being lost at age 5, crying near a toy store. Within days, 25% of participants \"remembered\" it—some even adding details like \"a kind old lady helped me. \"Their minds didn’t just accept the lie—they embellished it.\n\nWhy does this matter?Eyewitness testimony sends people to prison. Therapists recovering \"repressed memories\" can accidentally implant false trauma. Even ads exploit this: \"Remember how good our soda tasted as a kid?\" (You don’t—but now you think you do. )\nThree related subjects are eyewitness misidentification, how hypnosis rewires recall, and why nostalgia feels real.",
