  "clean_story": "Portable storage.  Travel’s silent partner. \"Suitcase\" merges \"suit\" (to follow) and \"case\" (a container)—because it follows you, holding what you can’t carry. Most see it as a box on wheels. But its design is a physics puzzle:The telescopic handle distributes weight like a lever, while spinner wheels pivot 360 degrees—each ball bearing reducing friction to near zero. Early versions were wooden trunks, strapped to trains in the 1800s. Then came 1970’s Bernard Sadow, who bolted wheels to a suitcase after watching an airport worker roll a heavy machine. Modern polycarbonate shells flex under 100 kg of pressure, then snap back—like a car bumper absorbing impact. Zippers use YKK’s coil design, where teeth interlock at 5 mm intervals, resisting 50+ kg of force before failing. Three related subjects are luggage security tech, airport logistics systems, and how humans pack efficiency.",
