  "clean_story": "Electroreception. Ampullae of Lorenzini. The ocean is home to sharks, predators equipped with a hidden sense that turns darkness into an advantage. This species has evolved remarkable electroreception, using jelly-filled pores called ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the faintest electrical signals in the water. Sharks rely on this ability to locate prey hidden in sand or murky depths, where eyesight fails. Their diet includes fish, crustaceans, and even buried creatures, all revealed by the muscle contractions that generate tiny electrical fields. Sharks are most active in low-light conditions, avoiding competition with daytime predators. During the day, they often rest in deeper waters, conserving energy while their electroreception remains alert. Their sensitivity to bioelectric fields is so acute that they can detect voltage changes as small as a few billionths of a volt per centimeter. This precision, combined with their streamlined bodies, allows them to strike with efficiency even in the most challenging environments. Sharks communicate and navigate using a combination of body language and electromagnetic cues, which may also help them sense Earth’s magnetic field during long migrations. Reproduction in sharks varies by species, but many give birth to live young that are immediately independent, relying on their electroreception to survive from the start. Three related subjects are the role of electroreception in marine predator-prey dynamics, the evolutionary adaptations of sensory systems in deep-sea environments, and the impact of human activity on shark habitats.",
