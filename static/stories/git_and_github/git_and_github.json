  "clean_story": "Version control. Teamwork without chaos. \"Git\" is short for nothing—its creator, Linus Torvalds, named it after British slang for \"unpleasant person,\" joking that he’s hard to work with. \"GitHub\" adds \"hub,\" a central place, because it turns Git into a social platform for code. Git tracks every change in a project like a time machine. Imagine writing an essay: you save \"Draft1,\" then \"Draft2_FixedIntro,\" then \"Draft3_Final(ish). \" Git does this automatically, but smarter. Instead of files like \"Website_V2_FINAL_REALLYFINAL. doc,\" you type `git commit -m \"Fixed login button\"` and Git snapshots the entire project at that moment. Need to undo a mistake? `git revert` jumps back like a video game save point. GitHub adds collaboration. Without it, sharing code is like emailing a group project—someone edits the wrong version, files get lost, and you end up with \"Final_Final_V3_CONFLICTED. copy. \" GitHub hosts the project online, so everyone works on the same latest version. Want to suggest a change? \"Fork\" the project (like photocopying a recipe), edit your copy, then propose a \"pull request\" (asking the original chef to try your tweak). The owner reviews, discusses, or merges it—all tracked in threads, not scattered emails. Companies like Google and Netflix use GitHub to manage code written by thousands. Open-source projects, like the Linux operating system, rely on it to let volunteers worldwide contribute safely. Even non-coders use it: lawyers draft contracts, writers collaborate on books, and scientists share research data. The precision comes from hashes—unique codes like `a1b2c3d` that label each commit. Change one character in a file, and the hash changes completely, exposing tampering. <[silence:1",
