  "clean_story": "Science seeks truth. Pseudoscience claims it. The word 'pseudoscience' combines 'pseudo,' meaning false, and 'science,' the systematic study of the natural world. While science relies on evidence, testing, and peer review, pseudoscience often presents ideas as facts without these steps. Imagine you’re trying to solve a puzzle. Science is like carefully fitting each piece based on evidence, while pseudoscience is like guessing where pieces go without checking if they match. For example, homeopathy claims that tiny amounts of a substance can cure illnesses, but rigorous studies show no consistent effect beyond a placebo. In contrast, vaccines work by training the immune system with weakened versions of pathogens, a process thoroughly tested and proven. Science evolves with new evidence, like how Newton’s laws were refined by Einstein’s relativity. Pseudoscience resists change, clinging to ideas even when disproven, like flat Earth theories despite overwhelming evidence of a spherical planet. Three related subjects are the psychology of belief, the role of skepticism in discovery, and how misinformation spreads in the digital age.",
