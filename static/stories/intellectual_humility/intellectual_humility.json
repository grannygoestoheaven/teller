  "clean_story": "\"Recognizing limits. Embracing growth. The term 'intellectual humility' combines 'intellect' and 'humility,' meaning a willingness to admit when you don’t know something and being open to learning. It’s like saying, 'I might not have all the answers, but I’m eager to find them. 'Intellectual humility is about understanding that no one knows everything and that being wrong is a chance to learn. It’s like admitting you don’t know how to solve a puzzle, then asking for help instead of guessing randomly. Imagine you’re in a debate, and someone presents a fact that contradicts your beliefs. Instead of arguing, you pause and say, 'Let me think about that. ' That’s intellectual humility in action. It’s not about being weak or unsure; it’s about being strong enough to admit when you’re wrong and curious enough to seek the truth. This mindset helps people work together better, solve problems more effectively, and build stronger relationships. Intellectual humility isn’t just about admitting you’re wrong—it’s about actively seeking out different perspectives and being open to changing your mind. It’s like being a detective who’s always looking for new clues, even if they contradict the ones you’ve already found. Three related subjects are the science of learning, the psychology of curiosity, and the art of effective communication. \"",
