  "clean_story": "Expectations shape reality. The Rosenthal Effect. Named after psychologist Robert Rosenthal, this phenomenon shows how our expectations can influence others' performance. It’s like when a teacher believes a student is gifted, and that student ends up performing better. The Rosenthal Effect is often called the \"Pygmalion Effect,\" inspired by a Greek myth where a sculptor falls in love with a statue he created, which then comes to life. In the 1960s, Rosenthal conducted an experiment in a school where teachers were told that certain students were expected to excel based on a test. In reality, these students were chosen at random. By the end of the year, those students showed significant improvement. This happened because the teachers, believing in their potential, unknowingly gave them more attention and encouragement. Imagine you’re playing a video game, and someone tells you that you’re a natural at it. You might try harder, feel more confident, and actually get better. That’s the Rosenthal Effect in action. It’s not magic; it’s about how positive expectations can lead to positive outcomes. This effect isn’t limited to schools. It can happen in workplaces, sports teams, and even at home. When a coach believes in an athlete’s potential, the athlete might train harder and perform better. Similarly, if a manager expects an employee to succeed, the employee might feel more motivated and capable. The Rosenthal Effect highlights the power of belief and support. It shows that our expectations can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where believing in someone’s potential helps them achieve it. However, it’s important to remember that this effect can work both ways. Negative expectations can lead to poorer performance. If a teacher thinks a student won’t do well, they might not give them the same support, leading to lower achievement. This phenomenon underscores the importance of fostering positive environments. By setting high expectations and providing support, we can help others reach their full potential. It’s like watering a plant and giving it sunlight; with the right care, it can grow and thrive. Three related subjects are the impact of mindset on learning, the role of feedback in personal growth, and how leadership styles influence team performance.",
