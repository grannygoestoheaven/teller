  "clean_story": "\"Paths shaped by weather. Climate dictates movement. \"\n\n\"Climate’s role in routes\" refers to how temperature, wind, and water patterns force humans, animals, and even data to take specific paths.\n\nThink of it like choosing a sidewalk. On a sunny day, you take the shortest path. In a storm, you detour under awnings or avoid flooded streets.\nFor 10,000 years, Arctic Indigenous groups followed sea ice routes—thick, stable winter ice became highways for sleds and hunting. When ice melted, they switched to kayaks along coastal currents. Today, GPS tracks show these same paths align with satellite-mapped ice ridges.\nTrade winds once pushed sailing ships across the Atlantic in 60-day loops. The 15th-century Volta do Mar—a \"turn of the sea\"—used these winds to slingshot Portuguese ships toward Africa, cutting travel time by weeks. Without them, Columbus’s 1492 voyage would’ve taken months longer.\nEven data obeys climate. Undersea internet cables avoid hurricane zones, and server farms cluster in cold climates (like Iceland) to save cooling costs. A 2021 heatwave in Oregon forced Google to shut down servers—proving even digital routes bend to weather.\nThree related subjects are animal migration math, desert trade shortcuts, and storm-proof city grids.",
