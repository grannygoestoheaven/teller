Ears bypassed, vibrations heard. \"Bone conduction\" describes how sound waves travel as tiny shakes through the bones of your face and jaw\u2014straight to the inner ear. It\u2019s like hearing a tuning fork pressed to your teeth, except the \"fork\" could be your own voice, footsteps, or even a hidden speaker. Most sounds reach you by air\u2014waves pushing eardrums like wind on a sail. Bone conduction skips the middleman. Vibrations rattle your jawbone, which acts like a bridge to the cochlea, where nerves turn shakes into signals your brain reads as sound. Try this:Plug your ears and hum. \u2014The rumble you hear isn\u2019t in the air. It\u2019s your vocal cords buzzing your skull. Military pilots use bone-conduction headsets to hear radio commands over engine roar. Swimmers wear waterproof versions to listen to music without blocking their ears underwater. The tech isn\u2019t new. Ludwig van Beethoven, deaf in later years, bit a rod connected to his piano to \"hear\" compositions through his jaw. Modern devices clip onto cheekbones, turning any surface\u2014even glasses\u2014into a speaker only you perceive. Three related subjects are underwater acoustics, hearing aid innovations, and how whales sense vibrations.", "timestamp": "20260301T095924Z"}
