  "clean": "Subnetting, Packet Switching.\n\n An IP network, or Internet Protocol network, is a system that allows devices to communicate over a digital network using a set of rules.  One aspect of IP networks is subnetting, which involves dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable segments.  This division helps in organizing and optimizing network performance by reducing congestion and improving security.  Each subnet operates as a distinct network, allowing for efficient routing and management of data.  Subnetting also aids in conserving IP addresses by allocating only the necessary addresses to each segment, promoting efficient use of resources.  Another aspect of IP networks is packet switching, a method of data transmission where information is broken down into smaller packets.  These packets are sent independently over the network and reassembled at the destination.  Packet switching enhances the reliability and efficiency of data transfer by allowing multiple packets to travel simultaneously through different paths.  This method contrasts with circuit switching, where a dedicated path is established for the entire communication session.  Packet switching is particularly beneficial for handling data traffic in modern networks, as it maximizes bandwidth utilization and minimizes latency.  IP networks rely on a structured addressing system to identify devices and ensure accurate data delivery.  Each device on the network is assigned a unique IP address, which serves as its identifier.  The IP address is composed of a network part and a host part, facilitating the routing of data to the correct destination.  This addressing system supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, with IPv6 offering a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices.  The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is ongoing, driven by the need for more addresses and enhanced network capabilities.  Network security is another important consideration in IP networks.  Measures such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls are implemented to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.  These security protocols are designed to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of information as it traverses the network.  Regular updates and monitoring are necessary to address vulnerabilities and respond to potential threats.  Ensuring secure communication is a dynamic process that requires continuous attention and adaptation to evolving challenges.
