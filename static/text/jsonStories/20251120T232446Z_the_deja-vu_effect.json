  "clean": "Recognition of unfamiliarity.  Temporal lobe activity.  Cognitive processing anomalies.  The déjà-vu effect is a psychological phenomenon where an individual feels an uncanny sense of familiarity with a situation that is objectively new.  This experience is often fleeting and can be described as a brief moment where the present seems to echo the past.  Research suggests that déjà-vu is linked to the brain's memory systems, particularly the temporal lobe, which plays a role in processing memories and recognition.  The sensation of déjà-vu is not fully understood, but it is considered a common experience, with estimates suggesting that up to 70% of people have encountered it at least once in their lives.  Scientific investigations into déjà-vu have explored various theories to explain its occurrence.  One hypothesis posits that déjà-vu arises from a miscommunication between the brain's short-term and long-term memory circuits, causing a new experience to be mistakenly recognized as familiar.  Neuroimaging studies have indicated that the temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus, may be involved in this process, as it is crucial for memory formation and retrieval.  Another theory suggests that déjà-vu could result from a brief delay in neural processing, leading to the perception of a time lag between sensory input and conscious awareness.  Despite its prevalence, déjà-vu remains an enigmatic subject within cognitive science.  Some researchers have explored the possibility that déjà-vu might serve as a cognitive check, a way for the brain to verify the accuracy of its memory systems.  This notion is supported by studies showing that déjà-vu is more common in individuals who are adept at recalling details from their past.  Additionally, déjà-vu has been observed in clinical settings, particularly among individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting a potential link between the phenomenon and neural activity in this brain region.  The study of déjà-vu continues to intrigue scientists and laypeople alike, as it touches upon the complex nature of memory and perception.
