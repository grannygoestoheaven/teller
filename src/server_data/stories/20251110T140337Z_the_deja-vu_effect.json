  "clean": "Memory anomalies, temporal lobe, cognitive neuroscience, familiarity.\n\n The déjà-vu effect is a phenomenon where an individual feels an uncanny sense of familiarity with a situation that should not be familiar.  This experience is often fleeting and typically occurs without any clear trigger.  Cognitive neuroscience suggests that déjà-vu is linked to memory anomalies, particularly within the temporal lobe of the brain.  This area is responsible for processing memories and recognizing familiar patterns, which may explain the sensation of having previously encountered a new experience.   Research has identified that déjà-vu is more commonly experienced by individuals with a higher level of education and those who travel frequently.  This may be due to the increased exposure to diverse environments and situations, which could enhance the brain's ability to recognize patterns.  Additionally, déjà-vu has been associated with stress and fatigue, suggesting that the brain's processing capabilities may be temporarily altered under these conditions.   Theories on the cause of déjà-vu vary, with some researchers proposing that it is a result of a split-second delay in the brain's processing of sensory information.  This delay may lead to the perception that the current moment has already occurred.  Others suggest that déjà-vu could be a form of memory retrieval error, where the brain mistakenly retrieves a memory that is similar but not identical to the present situation.
