Solving without words. \"\n\n\nThe term problem-solving in animals means using tools, memory, or tricks to overcome challenges—like a key unlocking a door.\n\n\nWe often think of animals as acting on instinct, like a squirrel burying nuts. But some go further.\nNew Caledonian crows bend wires into hooks to pull food from tubes. Octopuses unscrew jars for hidden crabs.\nA border collie named Chaser learned 1,022 object names—more than most toddlers.\n\n\nTheir methods aren’t random.\nElephants dig wells to reach water, then plug leaks with bark.\nRats time their moves to avoid traps.\nEven bees solve mazes faster by watching others.\n\n\nNo hands, no language—just trial, error, and memory.\nTheir solutions are precise, repeatable, and sometimes inventive.\n\n\nThree related subjects are tool-making in primates, animal memory experiments, and cooperative hunting tactics.",
