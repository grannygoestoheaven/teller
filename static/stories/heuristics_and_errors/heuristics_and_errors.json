  "clean_story": "\"Quick decisions. Mental shortcuts. The word 'heuristic' comes from the Greek word 'heuriskein,' meaning 'to find' or 'to discover. ' It refers to mental shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly, even when we don’t have all the information. These shortcuts are like cheat codes for the brain, allowing us to navigate the world efficiently. \\nHeuristics are everywhere. For example, when you’re choosing what to eat for lunch, you might pick the option that’s closest or quickest, even if it’s not the healthiest. This is a heuristic—it’s a rule of thumb that helps you make a decision without overthinking it. Another example is when you judge someone’s trustworthiness based on their appearance or tone of voice. These quick judgments are heuristics in action. \\nHeuristics can be useful, but they can also lead to mistakes. For instance, imagine you’re playing a game where you have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar. Instead of counting each one carefully, you might use a heuristic like 'the jar is about half full, so there are probably around 500 jellybeans. ' This quick estimate might be close, but it could also be way off. \\nHeuristics are especially useful in situations where time is limited, like driving a car. When you’re behind the wheel, you can’t afford to analyze every possible outcome of every action. Instead, you rely on heuristics to make split-second decisions, like braking when you see a red light or swerving to avoid a pedestrian. \\nOf course, heuristics aren’t perfect. They can lead to biases and errors, like assuming that because.",
