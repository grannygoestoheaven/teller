  "clean_story": "Keratin synthesis. Matrix cell division. Lunula visibility. Eponychium function. Nail growth begins in the nail matrix, a tissue located under the skin at the base of the nail. This matrix is responsible for producing new nail cells through a process of rapid cell division. As these cells multiply, they fill with keratin, a durable protein, and are pushed forward. The newly formed cells gradually harden and flatten, forming the visible part of the nail. The visible portion of the nail, known as the nail plate, is a result of continuous cell production in the matrix. The rate of growth can vary depending on factors such as age, nutrition, and overall health. On average, fingernails grow about 3 millimeters per month, while toenails grow at a slower pace. The lunula, the whitish crescent-shaped area at the base of the nail, is part of the matrix and can sometimes indicate health conditions. The eponychium, commonly referred to as the cuticle, plays a protective role in nail health. It seals the area between the nail plate and the skin, preventing pathogens from entering the matrix. Proper care of the cuticle is important to maintain the integrity of the nail and its growth process. Damage or infection in this area can disrupt normal nail growth and lead to deformities. Three related subjects are nail disorders, keratin structure, and nail care routines.",
