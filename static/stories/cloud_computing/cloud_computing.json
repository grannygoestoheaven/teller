  "clean_story": "Virtual storage. Remote power. The term *cloud computing* comes from network diagrams, where the internet was drawn as a fluffy cloud—a symbol for something vast, invisible, and always there. Most people think of it as online file backups or streaming movies, but the real shift is deeper: it turns someone else’s computers into *your* tools, without you needing to own, maintain, or even see them. Imagine borrowing a neighbor’s lawnmower only when you need it, then returning it—no storage, no repairs, no wasted space. That’s the cloud, but for computing power, databases, or even AI. Here’s how it works: Instead of running software or storing files on your laptop, you access them through a browser or app, while the heavy lifting happens on distant servers—warehouses filled with thousands of linked computers. When you edit a Google Doc, the typing happens on your screen, but the document lives on Google’s servers, updated in real time for collaborators. Netflix doesn’t send you a DVD; it streams movies from servers near you, adjusting quality based on your internet speed. The precision comes from *scaling*. A small business can rent just enough server space for its website, then instantly expand during a sales rush—like a restaurant adding tables only on busy nights. Giants like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure split their massive server farms into tiny, rentable slices, charging by the second. This lets startups launch globally without buying hardware, or scientists run climate models on supercomputers they’d never afford. But it’s not just convenience. Cloud providers build redundancy: if one server fails, another takes over instantly, like a backup generator kicking in during a blackout. Security teams monitor threats 24/7, often better than a small company could. The trade-off? You trust someone else with your data, and outages—like AWS’s 2021 crash that broke Slack, Zoom, and Disney+—remind us the cloud isn’t infallible. Edge computing. Serverless functions. The carbon footprint of data centers.",
