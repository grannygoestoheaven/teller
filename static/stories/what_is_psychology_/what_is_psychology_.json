  "clean_story": "\"Understanding minds. Shaping behavior. The word 'psychology' comes from the Greek words 'psyche,' meaning mind or soul, and 'logos,' meaning study. It’s the science of how people think, feel, and act. If we are used to thinking of psychology as just about therapy or mental health, it's just partially true. Psychology is much broader. It’s like a detective trying to solve the mystery of why people do what they do. Psychologists study everything from how we learn and remember to how we interact with others and make decisions. They use experiments, observations, and surveys to uncover patterns in behavior. For example, have you ever wondered why you remember some things easily but struggle with others? Psychology explains how memory works, like a filing system in your brain that organizes information based on importance and repetition. Or why do we sometimes make choices that seem irrational? Psychology explores how emotions and biases influence our decisions, like a hidden force guiding our actions. It’s also about understanding how people learn and develop. From the way children acquire language to how adults adapt to new technologies, psychology helps us see the steps behind these processes. And it’s not just about individuals—psychology also looks at groups, like how people behave in teams or how societies change over time. Three related subjects are the science of decision-making, the impact of social influences on behavior, and the fascinating ways the brain processes emotions. \"",
