  "clean": "Frequency.  Piezoelectric effect.  Acoustic impedance.  Ultrasonic transducers are devices that convert electrical energy into sound waves beyond the range of human hearing, typically above 20 kHz.  They employ the piezoelectric effect, where certain materials generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress.  This property allows the transducer to produce ultrasonic waves when an alternating current is applied.  The design and material of the transducer significantly influence its efficiency and frequency range.  In medical imaging, ultrasonic transducers are pivotal in ultrasound machines, enabling non-invasive internal examinations.  They emit sound waves that penetrate the body and reflect off tissues, creating echoes that are converted back into electrical signals.  These signals are then processed to form images of internal organs.  The ability to adjust the frequency and focus of the transducer enhances image resolution and depth of penetration.  Industrial applications of ultrasonic transducers include non-destructive testing and cleaning.  In testing, they detect flaws in materials by sending waves through objects and analyzing the reflected signals.
