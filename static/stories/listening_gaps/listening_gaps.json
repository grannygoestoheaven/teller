  "clean_story": "\"Missed words. Silent misunderstandings. \"\n\n\"Listening gaps\" describes moments when sounds or words disappear—either because the speaker skips them or the listener misses them.\n\n\nImagine a radio cutting in and out. You hear \"meet at— —o’clock,\" but the key detail vanishes. These gaps happen in conversations, music, or even machine translations. A singer might drop a lyric to catch their breath. A phone call might glitch, swallowing syllables.\n\nIn language learning, gaps force the brain to fill blanks—like solving a puzzle. Studies show listeners predict missing words 70% of the time using context. But mispredictions create humor or confusion. Example: A teacher says, \"The answer is— —elephant,\" and students guess \"relevant\" instead of \"irrelevant. \"\n\n\nGaps aren’t always accidents. Poets use them for rhythm. Lawyers exploit them to obscure truths. Even silence itself can be a gap—a pause that changes meaning.\n\n\nThree related subjects are sound masking techniques, predictive brain processes, and deliberate speech omissions.",
