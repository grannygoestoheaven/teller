  "clean_story": "**Art as commerce. Creativity meets profit. The term \"business of art\" merges *patronage*—Latin *patronus*, meaning protector—with modern markets, where artists trade skill for income. The shift began in the 15th century when guilds collapsed and artists like Albrecht Dürer sold prints directly to merchants. This model evolved into galleries taking 50% commissions, then online platforms like Etsy or Saatchi Art charging 5–20% per sale. For example, Banksy’s *Girl with Balloon* sold for $1. 4M in 2018, then self-shredded—boosting its resale value to $25. 4M in 2021. Revenue streams now include licensing (e. g. , Yayoi Kusama’s pumpkins on Louis Vuitton bags), crowdfunding (Kickstarter’s $650M pledged to art projects since 2009), and NFTs (Beeple’s *Everydays* sold for $69M via blockchain). Art fairs like Art Basel generate $4. 5B annually. Micro-transactions via Patreon fund 250,000+ creators monthly. Copyright law. Brand collaborations.
