  "clean_story": "Life’s interconnectedness. Nature’s balance. The word 'ecosystem' combines 'eco' (home) and 'system' (a network of parts working together). Biodiversity is the variety of life in all its forms, from tiny microbes to towering trees. Together, they form the web of life on Earth. We often think of ecosystems as just forests or oceans, but they’re everywhere—even in a drop of pond water. Each part, from plants to predators, plays a role in keeping the system healthy. For example, bees pollinate flowers, helping plants grow, while wolves control deer populations, preventing overgrazing. This balance ensures that no single species takes over, allowing diversity to thrive. Biodiversity isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the unique roles each species plays. Take coral reefs, for instance. They cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support about 25% of all marine life. Without them, countless fish and other creatures would lose their homes. Similarly, rainforests act as Earth’s lungs, producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide, which helps regulate the climate. However, biodiversity is under threat. Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and climate change disrupt ecosystems, causing species to disappear. When one species vanishes, it can trigger a chain reaction, affecting many others. For example, the loss of bees could lead to fewer crops, impacting both wildlife and human food supplies. Three related subjects are the impact of climate change on ecosystems, the role of keystone species in maintaining balance, and how human actions can help restore biodiversity.",
