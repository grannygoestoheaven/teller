  "clean_story": "Theory of computation. The rules of problem-solving. It’s the study of what problems can be solved and how efficiently. Think of it like a cookbook for computers, explaining which recipes (algorithms) work and how long they take to prepare (time complexity). At its core, theory of computation explores the limits of what computers can do. It asks: What problems can be solved with a given set of rules? For example, sorting a list of numbers is solvable, but predicting the stock market isn’t—at least not with the tools we have now. This field also studies how much time and resources are needed to solve these problems. Imagine you’re trying to find a specific book in a library. If the books are organized, you can find it quickly, but if they’re scattered randomly, it might take forever. Theory of computation helps us understand these differences and find the best ways to organize our \"library\" of data. One key concept is the idea of \"computability. \" Some problems are simply impossible to solve with a computer, no matter how powerful it is. For instance, there’s no algorithm that can predict every possible move in a game of chess and guarantee a win. This is because some problems are inherently unpredictable. Another important idea is \"complexity. \" Even if a problem can be solved, it might take so long that it’s impractical. For example, solving a Rubik’s Cube by trying every possible combination would take longer than the age of the universe. Theory of computation helps us find smarter ways to solve problems, like using patterns and shortcuts to speed things up. Theory of computation also looks at different types of machines and how they solve problems. For example, a Turing machine is a simple model that can simulate any computer algorithm. It’s like a toy train that can follow any track, no matter how complex. By studying these models, we can understand the strengths and limitations of real computers. This field also explores the idea of \"undecidability,\" where some questions can’t be answered definitively. For instance, there’s no way to write a program that can determine whether any given program will ever finish running or get stuck in an infinite loop. This is a fundamental limit of computation, like trying to find a map that shows every possible path in an infinite maze. Three related subjects are the history of computing, the future of artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mathematics.",
