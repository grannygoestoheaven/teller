  "clean": "Cellular automaton.  Emergent behavior.  Conway's rules.  The Game of Life, devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970, is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of cell patterns on a grid.  It operates on a simple set of rules applied to a two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells.  Each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.  The state of the grid evolves over discrete time steps, with the next state determined by the current configuration.  The rules governing the Game of Life are straightforward yet lead to complex behaviors.  A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.  A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.  All other live cells die in the next step, and dead cells remain dead unless they have exactly three neighbors.  These simple rules give rise to patterns that can grow, oscillate, or remain static.  The Game of Life is not just a mathematical curiosity; it has implications in various fields.  It serves as a model for systems that exhibit emergent behavior, where complex patterns arise from simple rules.  Researchers have used it to explore concepts in computation, artificial life, and complexity theory.  Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life is Turing complete, meaning it can simulate a universal constructor.  Three related subjects are cellular automata theory, emergent phenomena, and Turing machines.",
