  "clean_story": "Floating crowns.  War machines from math. \"Archimedes\" means \"master thinker\"—a title he earned by turning numbers into tools. Picture a bath overflowing:He didn’t just notice the water rise—he calculated that the spilled volume equaled his submerged body’s weight. This wasn’t luck. It was the birth of buoyancy physics, still used today to design ships and submarines. His real trick?Seeing invisible forces. A lever wasn’t just a stick—it was a formula: \"Give me a place to stand, and I’ll move the Earth. \"He proved it by single-handedly launching a 400-ton ship using pulleys and ropes. War made him practical. When Rome besieged Syracuse, he built mirrors to burn ships with sunlight—death rays from geometry. Catapults hurled rocks with eerie precision, their trajectories plotted like parabolas on sand. Yet his proudest work had no blood:\"The Sand Reckoner\" counted grains in the universe—10⁶³, a number so vast it mocked \"infinity. \"He died mid-problem, drawing circles in the dirt, telling a Roman soldier, \"Don’t disturb my diagrams. \"Three related subjects are ancient siege math, how levers lift skyscrapers, and pre-telescope astronomy.",
