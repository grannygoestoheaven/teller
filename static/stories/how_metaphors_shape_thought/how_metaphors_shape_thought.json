  "clean_story": "Thoughts as physical shapes.  Words bending minds. \"Metaphor\" comes from Greek metaphora—meaning \"to carry across. \"It’s like calling time a \"thief\" instead of just saying it passes. Studies show metaphors don’t just decorate language—they rewire how we think. In 2011, researchers gave people two crime reports—one called crime a \"beast,\" the other a \"virus. \"Those who read \"beast\" wanted harsher punishments. <[silence:1600ms>]\"Virus\" readers pushed for social reforms. Same facts. Different frames. Here’s why:Our brains process abstract ideas by mapping them to concrete experiences. Call love a \"journey,\" and suddenly we talk about \"hitting roadblocks\" or \"taking detours. \"The metaphor isn’t extra—it’s the scaffold. Even math relies on this. We \"grasp\" numbers by linking them to hand movements. Kids counting on fingers aren’t just learning—they’re building neural bridges between digits and space. Three related subjects are embodied cognition, framing effects in politics, and how dead metaphors fossilize in language.",
