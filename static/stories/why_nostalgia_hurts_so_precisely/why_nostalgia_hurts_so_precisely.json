  "clean_story": "A memory’s sharp edges.  The brain’s hidden scalpel. \"Nostalgia\" comes from nostos (homecoming) and algos (pain)—a bittersweet ache for a past that can’t be touched again. It hurts precisely because your brain isn’t just remembering. It’s editing. Here’s the mechanism:Your hippocampus pulls raw memories—sights, smells, sounds—but the prefrontal cortex trims the rough parts. Like a photographer cropping a photo to keep only the golden light. What’s left?A polished scene: your childhood home’s scent,  the exact pitch of a friend’s laugh,  the weight of a toy you haven’t held in decades. The pain isn’t the past. It’s the gap between that edited highlight reel  and today’s unfiltered reality. Example:Hearing a song from middle school doesn’t just remind you of the melody. Your brain replays the version of you who listened to it—confident,  carefree,  untouched by later failures. That’s why nostalgia stings like a paper cut. Small,  clean,  and impossible to ignore. Three related subjects are memory distortion tricks, why scents trigger emotions, and how brains predict future joy.",
