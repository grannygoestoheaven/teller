  "clean_story": "Stitches without needles. Glue made by the body.\n\n\n\"Bio-glue\" is short for biological adhesive—a gel or liquid that seals wounds like superglue but uses natural materials the body can absorb.\n\n\nSurgeons once relied on stitches or staples, which poke holes in skin and can leave scars. Bio-glues work differently: they bond to wet tissues, like sealing a leaky pipe with putty. Some use proteins from mussels (which cling to rocks in crashing waves), while others mimic the sticky silk of spiders.\nOne example: TissuGlu, a glue sprayed on incisions after surgery. It hardens in 30 seconds, holding skin edges together without stitches. Another, BioGlue, uses cow blood proteins to patch heart defects mid-surgery—strong enough to hold against pumping blood.\nThe trick? These glues react with moisture, forming a flexible seal that dissolves over weeks as the body heals.
