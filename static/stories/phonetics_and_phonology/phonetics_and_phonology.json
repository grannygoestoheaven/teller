  "clean_story": "Phonetics and phonology. Sounds and systems. Phonetics studies how sounds are made and heard, while phonology explores how those sounds function in language. Imagine phonetics as the science of sound itself—like a chef analyzing ingredients—and phonology as the recipe book that explains how to use them. Phonetics breaks down sounds into physical details, like how your vocal cords vibrate or how air flows through your mouth. It’s like dissecting a musical note to understand pitch, volume, and tone. Phonology, on the other hand, looks at the rules that govern these sounds in a language. For example, in English, the sounds 'p' and 'b' are distinct, but in some languages, they might be interchangeable. This is like knowing that in chess, each piece moves differently, even though they’re all part of the same game. Phonetics is universal, applying to all sounds in any language, while phonology is language-specific. Think of phonetics as the universal toolbox and phonology as the custom blueprint for each language. Together, they help linguists understand how speech works and how languages evolve. Three related subjects are the science of speech recognition, how accents develop, and the role of intonation in communication.",
