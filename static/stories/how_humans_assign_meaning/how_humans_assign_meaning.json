  "clean_story": "Patterns in chaos.  Brains as storytellers. \"Meaning\" isn’t found—it’s built. Like turning scattered stars into constellations, humans stitch raw data into narratives. Take a baby’s first cry. To parents, it’s hunger, fear, or joy—never just noise. The brain labels sounds, then fills gaps with guesses. Or consider money: A $20 bill is paper with ink—until collective trust turns it into lunch, rent, or power. Value is a shared hallucination. Even colors are assigned. Ancient Greeks saw \"glaukops\" (a blue-green mix) where we now split blue from green. Languages carve reality differently. The tool? Predictive processing. Your brain runs simulations, comparing input to past patterns. A shadow moves—your pulse spikes before you see it’s just a coat on a hook. Meaning is the brain’s shortcut to survive. Three related subjects are cultural symbols evolution, how metaphors shape thought, and AI’s struggle with context.",
