  "clean_story": "Words as invisible bridges.  Grammar’s silent architects. \"Preposition\" comes from Latin prae- (\"before\") + ponere (\"to place\")—because they sit before nouns, showing where ideas \"place\" in relation to others.

Take \"in\" vs. \"into\":\n\"She walked in the room\" (already inside) – \"She walked into the room\" (entering now). One letter changes motion to location. Or \"by\":\n\"The book by Hemingway\" (author) – \"She passed by the store\" (location) – \"Finish this by Friday\" (deadline). Same word, three invisible jobs. Some prepositions rebel against logic:\"He’s good at math\" but \"bad at math\"—never \"good in math\" or \"bad with math. \"No rule explains why. Others vanish in questions:\"Who did you talk to?\" (correct) vs. \"Who to?\" (dropped in speech). Grammar books call this \"preposition stranding. \"The deepest trick?Prepositions don’t just describe space—they shape time (\"since Monday\"), cause (\"died of hunger\"), and abstraction (\"lost in thought\").\nThree related subjects are idiom fossilization, syntax without rules, and how languages drop prepositions.",
