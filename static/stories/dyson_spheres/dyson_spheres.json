  "clean_story": "**Megastructures. Solar power on a cosmic scale.**\n\nA Dyson sphere is a hypothetical shell built around a star to capture its energy—like wrapping a light bulb in mirrors to gather every ray.\n\nStars waste most of their energy, radiating heat and light into empty space. A Dyson sphere would solve this by enclosing the star in a network of solar panels or habitats, turning stray sunlight into usable power. Think of it as a supercharged version of Earth’s solar farms, but big enough to harness an entire sun.\n\nThe idea came from physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960. He suggested advanced civilizations might build such structures to meet growing energy demands. A full sphere isn’t practical—gravity and material limits make it impossible—but a **Dyson swarm** (thousands of orbiting panels) could work. Even partial coverage would generate trillions of times Earth’s current energy output.\n\nHow? Imagine satellites the size of Texas, each beaming power via lasers or microwaves to planets or space colonies. A star like ours emits ~384 yottawatts (384 followed by 24 zeros) per second—enough to power quadrillions of cities.\n\nWe haven’t found one yet, but astronomers look for **infrared glows**—waste heat from a star wrapped in tech. Strange dimming patterns, like **Tabby’s Star (KIC 8462852)**, once sparked Dyson sphere theories (later debunked as dust).\n\nEnergy harvesters of this scale. The Fermi Paradox. Kardashev’s civilization types.",
