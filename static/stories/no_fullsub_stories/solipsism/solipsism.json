  "clean_story": "\"Mind's universe. Reality's question. Solipsism comes from the Latin 'solus,' meaning 'alone,' and 'ipse,' meaning 'self. ' It’s the idea that only your own mind is sure to exist. Everything else, like people, trees, or even the sky, might just be part of your imagination. \\n\\nImagine playing a video game where you’re the only real player, and everything else is just part of the game’s design. In solipsism, your mind is like the game console, creating everything you see and feel. This idea makes us wonder: if we can’t be sure anything outside our mind is real, how do we know what’s true?\\n\\nThink about dreaming. When you dream, everything feels real until you wake up. Solipsism suggests that life might be like a dream, where only the dreamer is real. Philosophers have debated this for centuries, trying to find ways to prove or disprove it. \\n\\nWhile solipsism is more of a thought experiment than a belief system, it challenges us to think deeply about perception and reality. It’s like asking, 'How do I know the world isn’t just in my head?'—a question that pushes the boundaries of philosophy. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the nature of consciousness, the philosophy of perception, and the exploration of virtual realities. \"",
