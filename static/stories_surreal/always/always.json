  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Always is the quiet pulse beneath existence—a thread stitching moments into eternity. It hums in the background, unyielding: the tide’s return, the breath between heartbeats, the way light bends toward dawn even through the thickest dark. Always is not a promise but a gravity, pulling time into loops—echoes of laughter lingering in empty rooms, scars that map old wounds, the stubborn bloom of weeds through cracked concrete.\n\nIt lives in contradictions: the constancy of change, the permanence of loss, the way absence carves its own shape into memory. Always is the shadow cast by fleeting things—the last note of a song, the scent of rain on hot pavement, the ghost of a touch still warm on skin. It is both anchor and abyss, the whisper that says this too when the world fractures. Not forever, but always—the difference being a kind of sacred exhaustion, the will to persist even when persistence feels like surrender.",
