  "clean_story": "**Diverse standards. Shifting ideals.**\n\nThe phrase \"women’s beauty\" describes how cultures define attractiveness—often tied to health, status, or tradition—but rarely stays the same over time.\n\nWhat’s praised in one era is rejected in another. In Renaissance Europe, full figures signaled wealth (like in Botticelli’s *The Birth of Venus*). By the 1920s, slim, boyish shapes dominated, mirroring flapper fashion. Today, social media amplifies trends faster: \"glass skin\" in Korea, freckles in Western ads, or natural hair movements challenging old norms. Even tools evolve—ancient Egyptians used malachite eyeliner (also an antiseptic), while modern filters reshape faces digitally.\n\nBeauty isn’t just looks; it’s power. Geisha makeup in 18th-century Japan marked artistic skill. In Mauritania, some communities once linked heavier bodies to prosperity. Now, brands like Fenty prove inclusivity sells—40 foundation shades at launch, forcing rivals to adapt.\n\nYet pressure remains. Studies show women spend **$3,756/year** on average for beauty products in the U.S. alone. The \"beauty premium\" is real: attractive people earn **3–4% more**, per *Journal of Economic Psychology*. But pushback grows—#NoMakeup campaigns, laws banning altered ads in France.\n\n**Next layers:** the biology of attraction, how war reshapes ideals, or why symmetry fascinates brains.",
