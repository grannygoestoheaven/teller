  "clean_story": "Event-driven architecture, asynchronous communication. Webhooks provide a method for web applications to communicate with each other in real-time. They enable one application to send data to another when a specific event occurs. This is achieved by registering a URL endpoint where the data should be sent. When an event triggers, the source application sends an HTTP request to the designated URL. This request typically contains a payload with relevant information about the event. The receiving application can then process this data immediately, allowing for prompt responses. This mechanism reduces the need for constant polling, enhancing efficiency. Security is a consideration when implementing webhooks. Verification methods such as secret tokens or signatures are often used to ensure authenticity. These measures help protect against unauthorized data access. Proper configuration and testing are crucial to maintain secure communication. Three related subjects are API integration, HTTP protocols, and event-driven systems.",
