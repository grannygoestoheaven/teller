  "clean_story": "\"Words and feelings. Machines and poetry. Poetry is like painting with words, using rhythm and emotion to create pictures in our minds. While computers can write sentences, they struggle to capture the heart and soul of poetry. \\n\\nImagine a robot trying to write a love letter. It knows the words but not the feelings behind them. This is because poetry often relies on deep emotions and personal experiences that machines don’t have. A computer can mix words based on patterns it’s learned, but it doesn’t understand what it feels like to be happy or sad. \\n\\nFor example, a poem about a sunset might talk about colors and light, but a human poet might also include how the sunset makes them feel peaceful or nostalgic. A machine might miss this layer of meaning because it doesn’t experience emotions. \\n\\nComputers use algorithms to predict which words go well together, like a chef following a recipe. But poetry is more like cooking from the heart, where the chef adds a pinch of this or that based on taste and intuition. \\n\\nWhile machines can help us write by suggesting words or checking grammar, they can’t replace the unique human touch that makes poetry special. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how artificial intelligence learns language, the role of creativity in art, and the future of human-machine collaboration in writing. \"",
