  "clean_story": "Correlation. Causation. The word 'correlation' comes from 'co-' meaning together, and '-relation,' meaning connection. It describes when two things happen at the same time or in a related way, like ice cream sales and drowning incidents both increasing in summer. \\n\\nBut correlation doesn’t mean causation. Just because two things happen together doesn’t mean one causes the other. In the ice cream example, neither ice cream nor drownings cause each other—they’re both caused by warmer weather. \\n\\nImagine you notice that every time you wear your lucky socks, your favorite sports team wins. You might think the socks cause the wins, but really, it’s just a coincidence. The team’s performance is likely due to the players’ skills, not your socks. \\n\\nScientists use experiments to test causation. For example, if they want to know if a new drug causes health improvements, they’ll compare a group taking the drug with a group taking a placebo. If only the drug group improves, the drug is likely the cause. \\n\\nCorrelation is useful for spotting patterns, but it’s not enough to prove causation. That’s why scientists look for other evidence, like controlled experiments or long-term studies. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how statistics can mislead us, the role of experiments in science, and the psychology behind superstitions.",
