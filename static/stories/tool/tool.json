  "clean_story": "Shaped objects.  Tasks made easier. \"Tool\" comes from Old English tōl, meaning a device for crafting or fixing—like an extension of the hand’s reach or strength. A tool doesn’t create work—it redirects effort. Imagine tightening a bolt with your fingers. Now use a wrench:—the same force turns faster, with less strain. Early tools were unmodified stones or sticks. Then came sharpened flint, leveraging physics:—a knife’s edge concentrates pressure, slicing cleaner than a dull rock. Precision tools reveal hidden limits. A micrometer measures thousandths of an inch——the width of a hair becomes a unit of error. A 3D printer’s nozzle lays plastic in layers thinner than paper, building shapes hands can’t carve. Tools also encode knowledge. A protractor’s markings teach angles without lessons. A piano’s keys map music theory to finger placement. Three related subjects are hand-axe evolution, mechanical advantage math, and tools as memory devices.",
