  "clean_story": "Everyday rhythms. Music woven into routine. The phrase *music in everyday life* refers to how melodies, beats, and songs shape moments most people don’t even notice—like background noise that’s actually steering moods, memories, and movements. Music isn’t just for concerts or headphones. It’s the alarm tone that jolts you awake, the elevator jingle that signals your floor, or the ice cream truck’s looped chime that pulls kids to the curb. Studies show the average person hears over **3 hours of music daily**, often without choosing it—supermarkets play slower tempos to make shoppers linger, while gyms blast 120–140 BPM tracks to sync with running strides. Even silence gets designed. Muzak, the company that pioneered \"functional music\" in the 1930s, crafted playlists to calm factory workers and boost productivity. Their research found that **lyric-free, 70–90 BPM instrumentals** reduced errors in assembly lines by 18%—proving music doesn’t need to be loud to be powerful. Today, brands like Starbucks use curated playlists to influence how long customers stay; a 2018 study linked their jazz-heavy afternoons to a **9% increase in coffee sales** after 3 PM. Then there’s the **earworm effect**—when a song sticks in your head like glue. Neuroscientists at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that **90% of people experience this weekly**, often triggered by repetitive lyrics or unresolved melodies (like the *McDonald’s \"Ba-da-ba-ba-baa\"* jingle). Your brain fills the gap, replaying the tune until it \"resolves. \" Music also acts as a **social glue**. Wedding DJs use the **\"energy curve\"**—starting with slow songs to gather crowds, then climbing to 128 BPM peaks (like *\"September\"* by Earth, Wind & Fire) to pack dance floors. Meanwhile, protest chants like *\"We Shall Overcome\"* use **call-and-response patterns** to unite voices, a tactic traced back to 19th-century labor hymns. From the **ding of a microwave** (a descending C-major arpeggio, designed to sound \"finished\") to the **default iPhone ringtone** (a marimba sequence chosen for its \"neutral urgency\"), music is engineering emotions before you realize it. The physics of sound waves meeting eardrums. The psychology of a chorus you can’t un-hear. The silent hum of a city’s soundtrack.",
