  "clean_story": "\"Reason vs. experience. Two ways to know the world. Rationalism starts with ideas, like building a house from a blueprint. Empiricism starts with observation, like learning by touching a hot stove. Both shape how we understand reality. \\nRationalism believes some truths are innate or come from logic alone. For example, mathematicians like René Descartes argued that certain principles, like 'two plus two equals four,' are self-evident and don’t need proof. This approach values deduction—starting with general rules and applying them to specific cases. It’s like solving a puzzle by following the instructions step by step. \\nEmpiricism, on the other hand, relies on sensory experience and evidence. Thinkers like John Locke said all knowledge comes from what we observe, like scientists testing hypotheses in a lab. This method emphasizes induction—drawing broad conclusions from specific observations. It’s like discovering gravity by watching an apple fall from a tree. \\nBoth approaches have strengths. Rationalism excels in fields like math and philosophy, where abstract reasoning is key. Empiricism dominates science, where experiments and data are crucial. Together, they form the foundation of modern thought, balancing logic and evidence to uncover truth. \\n.",
