Quantum gravity’s frontier.\n\n\"Planck scale\" refers to the tiniest possible units—like pixels of reality—where space and time behave unpredictably.\n\nImagine zooming into a grain of sand until it dissolves into blurry, flickering dots. That blur is the Planck scale: 1. 6 × 10⁻³⁵ meters, where physics as we know it breaks down.\n\nExperiments here don’t use microscopes. They rely on particle colliders (like CERN’s LHC) smashing protons at near-light speed, or gravitational wave detectors (like LIGO) listening for ripples from black hole mergers. These tools hunt for clues of quantum foam—a hypothetical, bubbling fabric of spacetime.\n\nOne approach: gamma-ray telescopes scanning for distortions in light from distant quasars.
