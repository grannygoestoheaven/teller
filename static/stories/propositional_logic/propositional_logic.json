  "clean_story": "\"Binary decisions. Logical structures. Propositional logic combines 'proposition' and 'logic. ' A proposition is a statement that can be true or false, like 'It's raining. ' Logic is the study of valid reasoning. Together, they form a system for evaluating simple statements and their combinations. \\n\\nImagine you're building a simple computer program that checks if it's raining and whether you have an umbrella. You want to know if you should take your umbrella based on these two facts. Propositional logic helps you structure this decision-making process. \\n\\nAt its core, propositional logic uses symbols and rules to represent and manipulate propositions. It starts with basic propositions, like 'R' for 'It's raining,' and 'U' for 'You have an umbrella. ' Then, it introduces logical operators to combine these propositions:\\n\\n- **Not** (¬): Reverses the truth value. '¬R' means 'It's not raining. '\\n- **And** (∧): Both propositions must be true. 'R ∧ U' means 'It's raining and you have an umbrella. '\\n- **Or** (∨): At least one proposition must be true. 'R ∨ U' means 'It's raining or you have an umbrella. '\\n- **If. then** (→): If the first proposition is true, the second must be true. 'R → U' means 'If it's raining, you have an umbrella. '\\n\\nWith these tools, you can create complex logical statements and evaluate their truth values. For example, '¬R ∨ U' means 'It's not raining or you have an umbrella. ' This structure enables computers to make decisions based on simple inputs. \\n\\nHowever, propositional logic has limitations. It can't handle nuances like 'It might rain' or 'You probably have an umbrella. ' For those, you'd need predicate logic or probability theory. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how propositional logic forms the basis for computer programming languages, the role of logical operators in everyday decision-making, and the challenges of translating complex human reasoning into logical structures. \"",
