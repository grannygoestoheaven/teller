  "clean_story": "**Faster thinking. Smarter machines. The \"future of computer science\" means teaching computers to solve problems humans can’t—or won’t—solve alone. Today’s computers follow instructions like a recipe. Tomorrow’s will *imagine* solutions, like a chef inventing new dishes from scratch. One path is **quantum computing**, which replaces binary 1s and 0s with \"qubits\" that can be both at once. Picture a maze where a normal computer tests each path one by one, but a quantum computer explores *all paths simultaneously*—then picks the fastest exit. Google’s 2019 experiment proved a quantum processor could solve a task in **200 seconds** that would take a supercomputer **10,000 years**. Another leap is **neuromorphic chips**, designed like human brains. Instead of crunching numbers in sequence, they process information in parallel, recognizing patterns instantly. Intel’s **Loihi 2** chip mimics 1 million neurons and learns from data *without being programmed*, like a baby identifying faces. These chips could power robots that adapt to new environments in real time, or phones that understand context—not just words—when you speak. Then there’s **self-healing code**. Today, bugs crash apps; tomorrow, software might *detect and fix* errors mid-execution, like a car repairing its engine while driving. MIT’s **ClearView** system already patches vulnerabilities in running programs by rewriting memory—no restart needed. The biggest shift? **Computers that explain themselves. ** AI like DeepMind’s **AlphaFold** predicts protein shapes but can’t say *how* it works. Future systems will **show their reasoning**, letting doctors trust a cancer diagnosis or engineers verify a bridge design. This isn’t just efficiency—it’s partnership. Yet challenges remain. Quantum computers need **near-absolute-zero** temperatures to function. Neuromorphic chips must shrink from lab prototypes to phone-sized devices. And self-healing code risks *creating* new bugs if it misdiagnoses a problem. But the goal is clear: machines that don’t just compute, but *collaborate*. Energy-efficient algorithms. Ethics for autonomous systems. The blur between digital and biological intelligence.",
