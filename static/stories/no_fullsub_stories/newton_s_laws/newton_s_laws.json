  "clean_story": "**\"Three laws of motion. Universal gravitation. Newton's laws and gravity theory bear his name. Isaac Newton, the 17th-century physicist, unified the work of predecessors like Galileo and Kepler. His laws describe how objects move, while his gravity theory explains why. \\n\\nCommonly, Newton's laws are thought of as simple rules for everyday motion. An object at rest stays at rest, and one in motion stays in motion—unless acted upon by an external force. But delve deeper, and you find precision, balance, and counterintuitive insights. Newton's second law, F=ma, quantifies force as mass times acceleration. It's like saying an object's resistance to change is proportional to its size and how quickly it's changing. Imagine a car: a small force can accelerate a light car quickly, but it takes more force to accelerate a heavy truck the same way. \\n\\nNewton's third law is often overlooked. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. This means every interaction involves two forces, acting on two different objects. It's why a rocket engine propels a spacecraft forward—by pushing exhaust backward. Or why you feel a recoil when you shoot a gun. \\n\\nNewton's laws aren't just about Earth. They govern the solar system, from planets orbiting the sun to comets swinging by. They're even used to calculate the trajectories of satellites and spacecraft. Yet, they have their limits. They break down at very high speeds, where Einstein's theory of relativity takes over. And they don't account for quantum effects, which become significant at very small scales. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the role of Newton's laws in space exploration, the challenges of applying them at extreme scales, and the philosophical implications of a universe governed by such precise, mathematical rules. \"\n\n(Char count: 849)",
