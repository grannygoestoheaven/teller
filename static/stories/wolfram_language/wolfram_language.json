  "clean_story": "\"Symbolic computation. A language that thinks like math. \"\n\nWolfram Language is named after its creator, Stephen Wolfram—a scientist who built a system where code behaves like equations, solving problems by manipulating symbols, not just numbers. <[silence:2400]\n\nMost programming languages treat code as step-by-step instructions. Wolfram Language treats it as a living formula—where `Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}]` doesn’t just draw a sine wave,it understands the math behind it and renders it perfectly. <[silence:2400]\n\nIt’s the engine behind Wolfram Alpha,the tool that answers questions like \"What’s the 100th digit of π?\" instantly—not by looking it up,but by calculating it on the spot. <[silence:2400]\n\nUnlike Python or JavaScript,it embeds 30+ years of algorithms—from solving differential equationsto generating 3D prints from a single command. <[silence:2400]\n\nExample:Type `Entity[\"Country\", \"France\"][\"Population\"]`,and it fetches real-time data—not from a database,but by querying curated knowledge. <[silence:2400]\n\nIts superpower?Brevity. A line of code can replace pages of traditional programming. Need a heatmap of global earthquakes?<[silence:1200]`GeoListPlot[EarthquakeData[]]`. <[silence:2400]\n\nThree related subjects are symbolic artificial intelligence, computational knowledge engines, and live coding environments.",
