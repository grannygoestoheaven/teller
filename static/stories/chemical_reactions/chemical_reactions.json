  "clean_story": "Atoms rearranging. Bonds breaking and forming. The term *chemical reaction* describes what happens when substances change into new ones—like ingredients mixing to make a cake, but at an invisible, atomic level. Chemical reactions are everywhere, though we rarely notice them. A log burning in a fireplace isn’t just disappearing—it’s wood combining with oxygen to become ash, smoke, and heat. Your stomach digesting food? That’s acids and enzymes breaking down molecules into energy. Even a battery powering a flashlight relies on metals reacting to release electrons. Every reaction follows a hidden rule: atoms can’t be created or destroyed, only rearranged. Think of it like LEGO blocks. You can take apart a spaceship and build a castle, but you’ll always have the same number of blocks. In reactions, atoms swap partners—like hydrogen leaving methane gas to join oxygen, forming water and carbon dioxide. Some reactions need a push to start, like a match’s flame to ignite paper. Others happen instantly, like vinegar fizzing when mixed with baking soda. Speed depends on temperature, concentration, or catalysts—substances that speed things up without being used themselves, like yeast in bread dough. Reactions can be dramatic: fireworks explode when metal salts burn, releasing colored light. Or subtle: iron rusting slowly when exposed to air and water. Some even power life—photosynthesis in plants turns sunlight, CO₂, and water into sugar and oxygen. Without reactions, cars wouldn’t run (gasoline combusting), medicines wouldn’t work (drugs interacting with body chemicals), or food wouldn’t spoil (microbial breakdown). They’re the unseen engine of the world, turning raw materials into everything we use, eat, and breathe. Energy transfer. Molecular dance. The invisible rules shaping matter.",
