It is concerned with the structure of arguments and the systematic analysis of reasoning.  Logic examines the form of arguments, distinguishing valid from invalid reasoning.  It is not concerned with the content of arguments but with the relationship between premises and conclusion.  In formal logic, symbolic notation is often used to represent logical expressions.  This allows for precise manipulation of logical statements and the derivation of conclusions.  Formal logic includes propositional logic, which deals with propositions and their connectives, and predicate logic, which involves quantifiers and predicates.
