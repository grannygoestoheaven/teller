The skin is the body's largest organ, covering approximately 20 square feet in adults.  It serves as a protective barrier against environmental hazards such as pathogens, UV radiation, and physical injuries.  The skin is composed of three primary layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.  Each layer has distinct functions and structures that contribute to the skin's overall role in homeostasis.  The epidermis is the outermost layer, primarily made up of keratinocytes, which produce keratin, a protein that strengthens the skin.  This layer also contains melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color and protection against UV radiation.  The dermis, located beneath the epidermis, contains collagen and elastin fibers that provide structural support and elasticity.  It houses blood vessels, nerves, and glands that regulate temperature and moisture.  The hypodermis, or subcutaneous layer, consists of connective tissue and fat, serving as insulation and cushioning for the body.  It plays a role in energy storage and helps anchor the skin to underlying structures.  Sebaceous glands within the skin secrete sebum, an oily substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin.
