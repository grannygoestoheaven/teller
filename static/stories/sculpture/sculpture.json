  "clean_story": "Sculpture. Shaping. materials. The. word. 'sculpture' comes. from. the. Latin. 'sculpere,' meaning. 'to. carve. ' It’s. about. transforming. materials. like. stone, wood, or. metal. into. three-dimensional. art. People. often. think. of. sculpture. as. just. statues. or. figures, but. it. can. be. anything. from. abstract. shapes. to. large. public. installations. What. makes. sculpture. unique. is. how. it. occupies. space, inviting. viewers. to. walk. around. and. see. it. from. different. angles. For. example, Michelangelo’s. 'David' isn’t. just. a. flat. image—it’s. a. lifelike. figure. that. seems. to. move. depending. on. where. you. stand. Similarly, modern. artists. like. Louise. Bourgeois. use. materials. like. fabric. and. steel. to. create. sculptures. that. explore. emotions. and. personal. stories. Sculpture. also. plays. with. light. and. shadow, making. the. same. piece. look. different. at. various. times. of. day. Think. of. a. bronze. statue. in. a. park: in. the. morning, it. might. cast. long. shadows, while. at. noon, the. light. might. highlight. its. textures. This. interplay. between. the. sculpture. and. its. environment. adds. depth. to. the. experience. Beyond. aesthetics, sculpture. has. been. used. for. centuries. to. tell. stories, honor. figures, or. express. cultural. values. Ancient. Egyptian. tombs. were. filled. with. sculptures. representing. gods. and. pharaohs, while. African. masks. and. totems. carried. spiritual. significance. Even. today, public. sculptures. serve. as. landmarks. or. symbols. of. community. identity. Related. concepts. include. architecture, which. shares. sculpture’s. focus. on. form. and. space, and. ceramics, where. shaping. clay. bridges. art. and. function.",
