  "clean_story": "Atmospheric composition. Thermal properties. Orbital dynamics. Stellar proximity. LTT 9779 b is an exoplanet that resides in a unique position within the universe. Located approximately 260 light-years away in the constellation of Sculptor, it orbits its host star, LTT 9779, at an exceptionally close distance. This proximity results in a rapid orbital period of just 19 hours, classifying it as an ultra-hot Neptune. The planet's size is comparable to Neptune in our solar system, yet its environmental conditions are vastly different. The atmosphere of LTT 9779 b is of particular interest to astronomers. Despite its extreme temperatures, which can exceed 1,700 degrees Celsius, the planet retains a significant atmosphere. This atmosphere is composed primarily of metals and silicates, suggesting a complex chemical makeup. Observations indicate the presence of clouds, which may be composed of silicate particles, contributing to the planet's reflective properties. Thermal properties of LTT 9779 b offer insights into the behavior of exoplanets in extreme conditions. The intense heat from its nearby star causes the planet's atmosphere to glow, emitting infrared radiation detectable by telescopes. This phenomenon provides a unique opportunity to study atmospheric dynamics and heat distribution on a planet outside our solar system. Understanding these properties helps refine models of atmospheric retention and loss in similar exoplanets. Three related subjects are the study of ultra-hot Jupiters, atmospheric escape in exoplanets, and the role of stellar radiation in planetary evolution.",
