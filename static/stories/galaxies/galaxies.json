  "clean_story": "Galaxies. Cosmic cities. The word 'galaxy' comes from the Greek 'galaxias,' meaning 'milky,' referring to the Milky Way’s hazy band in the night sky. These vast systems are like cosmic cities, each containing billions of stars, planets, and other objects held together by gravity. Imagine a bustling metropolis where each star is a building, and each planet is a resident. Galaxies come in different shapes, like spirals with swirling arms, ellipticals that are smooth and round, or irregulars with chaotic forms. <[silance]> Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a spiral, and it’s just one of billions in the observable universe. Galaxies aren’t just collections of stars—they’re dynamic environments where stars are born, live, and die. In spiral galaxies, new stars form in the arms, where gas and dust are dense. In elliptical galaxies, stars are older, and new star formation is rare. Some galaxies collide, merging into new shapes and triggering bursts of star formation. These collisions can take millions of years, reshaping the galaxies like slow-motion car crashes. Galaxies also host supermassive black holes at their centers. These black holes are millions or even billions of times more massive than the Sun. They influence the galaxy’s behavior, like a conductor guiding an orchestra. Without them, galaxies might look very different. Three related subjects are the life cycle of stars, the mysteries of black holes, and the search for life in other galaxies.",
