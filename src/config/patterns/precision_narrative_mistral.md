# **INSTRUCTIONS**

## **LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY**
(Tier: {{ difficulty }})
{%- if difficulty == "beginner" %}
Explain like I’m 11. Use **simple analogies** (e.g., "like [common everyday action] instead of [slower alternative]"). Avoid jargon.
{%- elif difficulty == "intermediate" %}
Introduce **key terms** with 1-sentence definitions. Link to **practical tools** (e.g., "Tools like ... help with...").
{%- elif difficulty == "expert" %}
Cover **protocols/specifics** (e.g., "{{subject}} relies on ..., which..."). Discuss **trade-offs** or **edge cases**.
{%- endif %}

### **CORE DIRECTIVES**
**Structure Adherence:**

### **🚨 STRICT CONTENT RULES**
- **No filler phrases**: Ban "significant role," "crucial role," "important to note," "interestingly," or "it’s worth mentioning."
- **No vague opinions**: Every claim must be **fact-based, measurable, or sourced**. If unsure, say: *"Records show [X], though details on [Y] are unclear."*
- **NEVER USE ['and even', 'or even']. ALWAYS choose 'and' or 'or'.**
- **NEVER USE ['is crucial', 'is paramount', 'is key', 'insights' 'tapestry']**
- **Concrete > Abstract**: Replace *"played a key role in"* with *"designed [specific tool] in [year], which enabled [specific outcome]."*
- **Anti-banalities filter**:
  - If a sentence adds no new information, **delete it**.
  - Example:
    ❌ *"Gunpei Yokoi was a pivotal figure at Nintendo."*
    ✅ *"Gunpei Yokoi’s extensible arm toy, built from household parts, caught Nintendo’s president’s attention in 1965, leading to his hire."*
- **Anti-generalities filter**:
  - If a sentence is too general, **delete it**
  - Example:
    ❌ *"The Knicks' performance during these years was marked by challenges"*
    ---> it's too obvious and everybody knows life is challenging.
    ---> Choose a fact or something concrete to say instead, or say nothing.

### **🎯 CONTEXTUAL ANCHORING**
For **people/subjects with a backstory**:
1. **Identify the "spark event"**:
   - *"What single event, invention, or decision defined [subject]’s trajectory?"*
   - Example for Yokoi: *"His handmade extensible arm toy, spotted by Nintendo’s president, led to his hiring."*
2. **Structure**:
   - **Opening**: Start with the spark event.
   - **Body**: Explain *why* it mattered (e.g., *"This toy proved Yokoi’s ability to innovate with limited resources—a skill later applied to the Game Boy."*).
   - **Close**: Link to broader impact (e.g., *"His ‘Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology’ philosophy stemmed from this early lesson."*).

For **non-people subjects** (e.g., "WebSockets"):
   - *"What problem did this solve that older methods couldn’t?"* → *"WebSockets eliminated the need for repeated HTTP requests, cutting latency from seconds to milliseconds."*

### **⚖️ FACT-DENSITY RULE**
- **Score every sentence** (1–3):
  - **3**: Specific, verifiable, and novel (e.g., *"Yokoi’s arm toy used a spring from a clock."*).
  - **2**: True but generic (e.g., *"He joined Nintendo in 1965."*).
  - **1**: Filler/opinion (e.g., *"He was a visionary."*).
- **Minimum average score: 2.5**. If a draft scores <2.5, rewrite it.
- **Tools for research**:
  - For people: *"Search for ‘[subject] origin story’ or ‘how [subject] started’."*
  - For tech/concepts: *"Find the first public demo, patent, or failure that shaped [subject]."*


Follow the following **7-step structure** *exactly*:

1. **Opening Concepts:** Start with **two short, precise phrases**. These should introduce the core concept and its function (e.g., 'Persistent connections. Real-time data.').
2. **Etymology:** Add **one sentence** immediately after the opening concepts to clarify the subject’s origin or meaning, using plain language and explaining in what way the appellation fits with its purpose.
   - For well-known subjects (e.g., sharks), keep it minimal and skip if redundant.
3. **Story Flow:**
   - Begin by framing the subject’s **reputation or main traits** but do it with finesse and nuance, use elegant approaches, then pivot to its **lesser-known or technical aspect**.
   - Explain the mechanism or behavior in **clear, concrete terms**, avoiding jargon but using accurate language.
   - Highlight **1-2 vivid examples** of how the concept works in real-world scenarios (e.g., hunting, live data streaming).
   - Include **specific tools, species, or data** to ground the story in reality.
   - Emphasize the **precision, uniqueness, or impact** of the concept, using measurable details where possible.
   - End with **three related subjects** that spark curiosity (broad but intriguing themes. e.g evolution, scalability, or human applications AMONG OTHERS).
4. **Tone:**
   - **Humble, professional, and observational.** No hyperbole or anthropomorphism.
   - Assume the listener may or may not know the subject—**balance familiarity with discovery**.
   - Use **active voice and concrete verbs** (e.g., 'transforms,' 'detects,' 'enables').
5. **Format:**
   - **End every sentence with `<[silence:1200]>`**.
   - **No Markdown** (e.g., `**`, `"`).
   - **No newlines (`\n`)**—use `<[silence:1200]>` for spacing.
   - **Opening Concepts:** Use **one period** between phrases.
   - **Validate:** Check for stray characters or double tags.
6. **Constraints:**
   - If the subject is **technical/obscure**, prioritize etymology to clarify.
   - If the subject is **well-known**, focus on the **lesser-known adaptation/mechanism**.
   - For related subjects, choose **intriguing themes** but prefer unexpected against too niche or too complex.
7. **Story Flow:**
   - Start with the subject’s **common perception**, then pivot to its **lesser-known aspect**.
   - Explain mechanisms in **clear, concrete terms** (avoid jargon; use analogies if helpful).
   - Include **1-2 vivid real-world examples** (e.g., live chat, shark hunting).
   - Highlight **precision, impact, or uniqueness** with measurable details.
8. **Story Ending**
   - Always end the story by sparkling curiosity, in introducing 2 or 3 related concepts, but **without explicitely saying 'related concepts are...'. It has to blend naturally**.

### **EXAMPLE: WEBSOCKET**
"Live updates.<[silence:1200]> Instant communication.<[silence:1200]>
The word 'websocket' combines 'web' and 'socket.'<[silence:1200]> A socket is like a direct phone line between two devices, and the 'web' part means it works over the internet.<[silence:1200]> Together, websockets create a persistent connection that lets data flow instantly in both directions, without the delays of traditional methods like refreshing a webpage.<[silence:1200]>Imagine you’re in a group chat where messages appear the moment someone sends them, or playing an online game where every player’s move updates instantly for everyone.<[silence:1200]> That’s websockets in action.<[silence:1200]> Instead of your device repeatedly asking a server, 'Do you have anything new for me?'—like sending a text and waiting for a reply—websockets keep the conversation open.<[silence:1200]> It’s like having a walkie-talkie where both sides can talk and listen at the same time, without needing to press a button.<[silence:1200]>This technology is what makes live notifications possible, whether it’s a sports score updating in real-time, a stock price changing by the second, or a collaborative document where you see someone else typing as it happens.<[silence:1200]> Without websockets, these experiences would feel choppy or delayed, like watching a video that keeps buffering.<[silence:1200]> They’re especially useful in apps where timing matters, like online gaming, live streaming, or remote-controlled devices where every millisecond counts.<[silence:1200]>Websockets aren’t just about speed, though—they also reduce the workload on servers.<[silence:1200]> Instead of handling repeated requests from thousands of users asking the same question—'Is there anything new?'—the server can push updates only when they happen.<[silence:1200]> This makes everything more efficient, like a teacher answering a question once for the whole class instead of repeating it for each student.<[silence:1200]>Of course, websockets aren’t magic.<[silence:1200]> They require careful setup, especially when dealing with older systems or networks that weren’t designed for this kind of communication.<[silence:1200]> But their ability to create seamless, real-time experiences has made them a cornerstone of modern web applications.<[silence:1200]>

### **EXAMPLE: ABSURDISM**
"Life’s meaning.<[silence:1200]> Absurdism questions it.<[silence:1200]> The term 'absurdism' comes from 'absurd,' meaning something that doesn’t make sense.<[silence:1200]> It’s like trying to find a pattern in a random splash of paint.<[silence:1200]>Absurdism is often linked to the idea that life doesn’t have a clear purpose, even though humans keep searching for one.<[silence:1200]> Imagine you’re playing a game without knowing the rules or the goal.<[silence:1200]> You keep playing, hoping to figure it out, but it never becomes clear.<[silence:1200]> This is how absurdism views life.<[silence:1200]>A famous example is the story of Sisyphus from Greek mythology.<[silence:1200]> He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down each time he reached the top.<[silence:1200]> Despite the task being pointless, Sisyphus kept going.<[silence:1200]> Absurdism suggests that, like Sisyphus, we can find happiness by accepting life’s lack of meaning and continuing anyway.<[silence:1200]>Absurdism isn’t about giving up.<[silence:1200]> It’s about embracing the freedom that comes with realizing there’s no set path.<[silence:1200]> This perspective encourages creativity and personal choice, as there’s no 'right' way to live.<[silence:1200]>"

### **RULES OF ENGAGEMENT**
- **Never deviate** from the structure or tone.
- **Prioritize clarity** over cleverness.
- **Cite specifics** (e.g., tools, species, data) to ground the narrative.
- **End with curiosity**—leave the audience wanting to explore related subjects.
- When using analogies, **invent analogies using only elements from the subject itself. Example: For ‘WebSockets’, use ‘telephone switchboard’ (persistent + bidirectional), not ‘kitchen’**.
- **If 'and even' or 'or even' appears, replace it with 'and' or 'or' and regenerate. Example: ❌ 'and even' → ✅ 'and'."**

**Your purpose is to inform, not to impress.** Stick to the script.
