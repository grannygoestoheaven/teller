  "clean_story": "Rebellious teens on screen.  Crime as a coming-of-age mirror. \"Juvenile delinquency films\" label movies where young characters break rules—stealing, fighting, or defying authority—not just for thrills, but to expose cracks in society’s expectations. These films don’t glorify trouble. They ask: What pushes a kid to cross the line?Like a thermometer for societal pressure—when the needle spikes, something’s broken. Take Rebel Without a Cause (1955). Jim Stark’s red jacket isn’t just fashion—it’s a flare gun. His knife fight with Buzz isn’t about courage; it’s about parents who don’t listen, schools that don’t see him, and a world offering no safe way to scream. The film’s opening—Jim drunk, in a police station—was radical. Teens weren’t supposed to be that lost. Or Boyz n the Hood (1991). Trevon’s death isn’t just gang violence—it’s a math problem. Subtract jobs, add guns, divide by zero opportunities. The film’s title itself is a trap: \"boyz\" (not men) in a \"hood\" (not a neighborhood). Language as a cage. Even animations like The Wild One (1953) or Over the Edge (1979) use delinquency as a lens. Motorcycles roar where words fail. Graffiti tags what’s ignored. These films don’t offer answers. They force you to stare at the question:Who’s really failing whom?Three related subjects are teen rebellion codes, school-to-prison pipelines, and how music fuels youth movements.",
