  "clean_story": "Language shapes thought. Thought shapes language. The term 'language' refers to the system of words and symbols we use to communicate. 'Thought' is the process of using ideas and reasoning to understand the world. Together, they form a cycle where each influences the other. Imagine you’re learning a new word like 'serendipity,' which means finding something valuable by accident. Once you know this word, you start noticing examples of serendipity in your life—like bumping into an old friend or discovering a great book randomly. This shows how language can shape your thoughts by giving you new ways to see the world. On the other hand, your thoughts also shape language. For example, if you often think about the environment, you might start using words like 'sustainability' or 'carbon footprint' more often. Your thoughts guide the words you choose, and over time, this can even change how a language evolves. A famous experiment by psychologist Lera Boroditsky showed how language affects thought. She found that people who speak languages with strict gender rules, like German or Spanish, tend to think of objects as having more personality than those who speak languages without gender, like English. This suggests that the structure of a language can influence how people perceive the world. Language and thought also work together in problem-solving. When you’re trying to figure out a puzzle, you might talk to yourself to organize your thoughts. This inner dialogue helps you break down the problem and find a solution. Without language, it would be much harder to think through complex ideas. Three related subjects are how bilingualism affects cognition, the role of metaphors in shaping thought, and the evolution of language over time. <[sil.",
