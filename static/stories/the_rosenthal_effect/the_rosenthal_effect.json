  "clean_story": "Expectation.  Perception.  Academic achievement.  Teacher-student interaction.  The Rosenthal Effect, also known as the Pygmalion Effect, refers to the phenomenon where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance.  This concept emerged from a study conducted by psychologist Robert Rosenthal in the 1960s.  In his experiment, Rosenthal demonstrated that when teachers were led to believe that certain students were expected to perform better academically, those students indeed showed significant improvement.  The study highlighted the influence of teacher expectations on student performance.  The mechanism behind the Rosenthal Effect involves subtle changes in teacher behavior.  Teachers may provide more attention, feedback, and encouragement to students they expect to excel.  This positive reinforcement fosters a supportive learning environment, which can enhance student confidence and motivation.  Consequently, students internalize these expectations and perform in ways that align with them.  The implications of the Rosenthal Effect extend beyond education.  It underscores the importance of expectations in various interpersonal interactions, including workplace dynamics and personal relationships.  Awareness of this effect can lead to more mindful communication and the fostering of positive outcomes.  By understanding the power of expectations, individuals can consciously influence the performance and behavior of others.  Three related subjects are self-fulfilling prophecy, stereotype threat, and implicit bias.",
