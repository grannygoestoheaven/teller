  "clean_story": "\"Cosmic explosion. Universe begins. The Big Bang Theory describes how the universe started from an incredibly hot, dense point and has been expanding ever since. It’s like the universe began as a tiny speck and has been stretching out like dough in an oven ever since. This theory explains why galaxies are moving away from each other and why the universe is full of stars and planets. Imagine the universe as a balloon with dots on it. As you blow up the balloon, the dots move farther apart. This is similar to how galaxies move away from each other as the universe expands. The Big Bang didn’t happen at a single point in space; instead, space itself has been stretching out from everywhere at once. This means there’s no center of the universe—everywhere is the center. The Big Bang Theory also explains the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is like the afterglow of the early universe. This faint glow fills the entire universe and is evidence of the intense heat from the very beginning. <[silance]> Scientists study this radiation to learn more about the universe’s early days, just like archaeologists study ancient artifacts to understand the past. The theory doesn’t explain what caused the Big Bang or what came before it. It’s like a movie that starts with the first scene already in progress—we don’t see what happened before. Despite this mystery, the Big Bang Theory is supported by many observations, making it the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. <[silance]>",
