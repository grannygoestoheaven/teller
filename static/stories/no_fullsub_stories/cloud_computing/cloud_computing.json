  "clean_story": "\"Scalability. On-demand resources. Cloud computing combines the words 'cloud' and 'computing. ' It's like having a vast, invisible data center in the sky, ready to provide computing power whenever you need it. Unlike traditional servers, which are fixed and can't easily adapt to changing demands, the cloud can scale up or down in minutes. \\n\\nThink of it like a power grid. When you turn on a light, you don't worry about generating the electricity yourself—you just flip the switch and it's there. The cloud works similarly, but with computing resources instead of power. You only pay for what you use, and you can access as much or as little as you need, whenever you need it. \\n\\nThis flexibility has revolutionized industries. For instance, Netflix uses the cloud to stream movies and TV shows to millions of users simultaneously. During peak viewing hours, it can automatically add more servers to handle the increased demand, then scale back down when things quiet down. Without the cloud, Netflix would need to maintain a massive, expensive infrastructure that's mostly idle most of the time. \\n\\nCloud computing also enables new business models. Instead of buying software, you can subscribe to it as a service. This is known as Software as a Service, or SaaS. Google Docs, for example, is a SaaS product. You don't need to install anything or worry about updates—you just open your web browser and start working. The cloud handles all the heavy lifting. \\n\\nHowever, cloud computing isn't without its challenges. Security and privacy are major concerns. With data stored off-site, there's always a risk of unauthorized access. Plus, relying on an internet connection means downtime can occur if the connection is lost. But despite these challenges, the benefits of cloud computing—flexibility, scalability, and cost savings—have made it a cornerstone of modern computing. \\n\\nThree related subjects are how the cloud is transforming data centers, the ethical considerations of data privacy in the cloud, and the role of the cloud in enabling artificial intelligence. \"",
