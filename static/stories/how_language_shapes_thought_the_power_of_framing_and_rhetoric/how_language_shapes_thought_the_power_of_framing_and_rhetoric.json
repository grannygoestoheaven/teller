  "clean_story": "Language shapes thought. Framing and rhetoric guide it. The word 'framing' comes from the idea of putting something in a box, like a picture frame. It means how we present information to influence how people see it. Rhetoric is the art of using language to persuade or inspire. Together, they shape how we think and make decisions. Imagine you’re describing a glass that’s half full. If you say it’s 'half empty,' people might feel negative. But if you say it’s 'half full,' they might feel hopeful. The same situation, but the words change how we think about it. This is the power of framing. Rhetoric works similarly. A speaker might use vivid words or emotional language to make their point stronger. For example, saying 'We must fight for our freedom' is more powerful than 'We should try to get our freedom. ' The first phrase makes people feel more urgent and passionate. These tools are used in politics, advertising, and everyday conversations to shape our thoughts and actions. Three related subjects are the psychology of persuasion, the role of media in shaping public opinion, and how language evolves over time. \"",
