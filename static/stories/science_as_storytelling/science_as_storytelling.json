  "clean_story": "Facts as characters.  Data with a plot. \"Science as storytelling\" means treating discoveries like unfolding tales—where hypotheses are questions, experiments are twists, and results rewrite the ending. Think of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species not as a textbook but as a detective story. Clues: finch beaks on different islands. Suspect: natural selection. The reveal? Life’s diversity isn’t random—it’s edited by survival. Or take Marie Curie’s notebooks. Still radioactive today, they’re like a horror story’s cursed artifact—proof her work glowed long after she did. Every smudged equation tells of nights spent chasing polonium’s ghostly signal. The best science stories hide their mechanics. A graph of CO₂ levels isn’t just numbers—it’s a time-lapse of Earth holding its breath. The \"hockey stick\" curve? A cliffhanger: Will we cut emissions in time?Even failures become legends. Thomas Midgley Jr. ’s \"safe\" refrigerant (Freon) seemed heroic—until the ozone plot twist. Now his invention is the villain in a cautionary tale about unintended consequences. Three related subjects are how metaphors shape theories, data as visual narratives, and why myth outlives fact.",
