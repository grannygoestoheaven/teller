  "clean_story": "A dot.  The smallest mark with the biggest job.\n\nThe word \"dot\" comes from Old English dott—a tiny, precise point.\nIt’s the pause in a sentence, the decimal in math, the seed of every line. Without dots, text would blur into chaos—like words shouted all at once.\nIn printing, a dot is a pixel’s ancestor. A 600-DPI printer fires 360,000 dots per square inch—each smaller than a red blood cell—yet together they fool the eye into seeing smooth curves.\nMorse code turns dots into time: A single dot (dit) lasts one unit, a dash three. Operators once sent 40+ words per minute—faster than typing—using just these two symbols.\nEven silence needs dots. In music, a dot after a note stretches its sound by half—turning a quarter note into three beats. Beethoven’s Fifth starts with four notes, but the dot on the third makes it unmistakable.\nThree related subjects are Braille’s raised dots, halftone printing tricks, and how pixels mimic dots.",
