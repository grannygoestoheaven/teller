  "clean_story": "\"Plastic replacements. Materials that vanish or return to nature. \"\n\nThe term plastic alternatives refers to substances designed to do the same job as plastic—hold, protect, or package—but without lingering for centuries in landfills or oceans.\n\nMost people think of plastic as unreplaceable: cheap, strong, and everywhere. Yet its biggest flaw is permanence—like a guest who never leaves, even when the party’s over.\nThe alternatives work differently. Some, like PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoates), are eaten by bacteria in soil or water, breaking down into harmless gases. Others, like mycelium (mushroom roots), grow into shapes—packaging, bricks, even coffins—in days, then compost like garden waste.\nA restaurant in Bali now serves straws made from rice and tapioca—edible, tasteless, and dissolving in warm water. A shoe company uses algae foam for soles, pulling carbon from the air as it grows.\nThe shift isn’t just about swapping materials. It’s about redesigning how we use them. A seaweed-based water pod, for example, holds liquid like a bottle but disappears once empty—no cap, no label, no trash.\nStill, challenges remain. Some alternatives need industrial composters to break down. Others cost 2–5x more than plastic. Yet in India, banana-stem fiber is now cheaper than plastic for certain packaging—proving solutions hide in local crops.\nCircular economies.\nMaterials that heal the soil.\nDesign that disappears on cue.",
