  "clean_story": "\"Water-repelling shields. Nature’s trick for staying dry. \"\n\nThe word hydrophobic comes from Greek: hydro (water) + phobos (fear). It describes surfaces that push water away, like a duck’s back or a freshly waxed car. <[silence:2400]\n\nMost materials let water spread or soak in. But hydrophobic surfaces trap tiny air pockets in their texture—like a bed of nails for droplets. Water can’t grip, so it beads up and rolls off. <[silence:2400]\n\nThe lotus leaf is the classic example. Its bumpy surface, covered in waxy crystals, forces raindrops to cleanse dirt as they slide. Scientists copied this for self-cleaning paints and stain-resistant fabrics. <[silence:2400]\n\nExtreme versions, called superhydrophobic, make water bounce like a rubber ball. A droplet hitting these surfaces can rebound in 10 milliseconds—faster than a blink. Used in pipes, they cut drag by 40%, saving energy. <[silence:2400]\n\nThree related subjects are bio-inspired materials, fluid dynamics tricks, and anti-icing coatings.",
