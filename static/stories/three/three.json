  "clean_story": "Smallest odd prime.  Foundation of counting. \"Three\" comes from the Old English þrīe, tied to the Proto-Germanic thrijiz—a word so ancient it shares roots with Latin tres and Greek treis. It’s the first number that forms a triangle,  the minimal shape needing sides to stand. In nature, three stabilizes:Tripod legs never wobble,  carbon bonds in diamonds lock into threes,  and human perception splits vision into red-green-blue. Cultures encode it as completeness:Past-present-future.  Beginning-middle-end.  Even fairy tales obey its rhythm—three wishes,  three trials,  three bears. Mathematically, it’s the only prime that’s also a Fibonacci number,  sitting between one’s unity and five’s chaos. Divide anything into thirds,  and symmetry breaks—unlike halves,  it forces asymmetry,  the start of complexity. Three related subjects are prime number patterns, cultural symbolism in numbers, and how triangles shape structures.",
