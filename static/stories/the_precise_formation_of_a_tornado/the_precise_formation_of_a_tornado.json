  "clean_story": "Swirling winds. A funnel from the sky. The word *tornado* comes from the Spanish *tronada*, meaning \"thunderstorm,\" because these violent twisters often form during severe storms. Most people picture tornadoes as monstrous, destructive spirals—but their birth starts small, with a simple clash of air. Warm, moist air near the ground rises like an invisible hot-air balloon, while cold, dry air rushes in above it. When these two layers meet, the warm air twists upward, creating a horizontal spinning effect, like rolling a pencil between your palms. Now, imagine a thunderstorm moving over this spinning air. The storm’s updraft—its powerful upward wind—tilts the horizontal spin into a vertical column, like flipping a spinning plate upright. This is the tornado’s *mesocyclone*, a rotating core inside the storm. If the spin tightens and touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. The strongest tornadoes form in *supercells*—massive, long-lived thunderstorms with deep rotation. Doppler radar detects their wind patterns, but the final trigger—why some spins become tornadoes and others don’t—remains a puzzle. One clue: the *rear-flank downdraft*, a rush of cool air that wraps around the storm’s base, squeezing the spin tighter. Tornadoes vary in size and speed. A weak one might last minutes, with winds under 110 mph, while a violent EF5 can exceed 300 mph, flattening everything in its path. Their paths depend on the storm’s movement—some hop like a skipping stone, others carve straight lines for miles. Forecasters watch for signs: a *wall cloud* (a lowered, rotating cloud base), *debris clouds*, or a loud roar like a freight train. But even with warnings, their unpredictability makes them deadly. What shapes their power? How do they dissolve? And why do some storms spawn dozens while others produce none?",
