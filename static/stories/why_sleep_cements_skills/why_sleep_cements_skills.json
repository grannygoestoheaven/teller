  "clean_story": "\"Practice during sleep.  The brain replays and strengthens skills overnight. \"\n\nThe phrase \"sleep cements skills\" comes from how the brain repeats daytime actions in slow-motion while you rest—like a video replaying in your mind.\n\nYou might think learning stops when you close your eyes. But studies show the brain reactivates the same neurons used while practicing a piano piece, a sport, or even a video game. It’s like your brain traces over the same lines to make them darker and clearer.\n\nExample: Pianists learning a new melody perform 20% better after a night’s sleep—even without extra practice. Their brains fire the same finger-movement patterns during deep sleep, locking in the muscle memory.\n\nAnother test: People solving a maze improve 3x faster after sleeping, compared to staying awake the same amount of time.\nThis isn’t magic—it’s synaptic pruning. The brain trims weak connections and strengthens the useful ones, like editing a rough draft into a clean final version.\n\nThree related subjects are memory consolidation, REM sleep functions, and neuroplasticity limits.",
