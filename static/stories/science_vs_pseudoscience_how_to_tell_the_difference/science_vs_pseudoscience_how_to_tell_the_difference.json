  "clean_story": "Science seeks answers. Pseudoscience claims them. The word 'science' comes from Latin, meaning 'knowledge. ' It’s a process of testing ideas with evidence, like a detective solving a mystery. We may usually believe that science is just about facts, but it's just partially true. Science is a method, not just a collection of facts. It starts with a question, then tests possible answers through experiments and observations. If the evidence supports the idea, it’s accepted—until new evidence challenges it. This is how we know the Earth orbits the Sun or that germs cause disease. Pseudoscience, on the other hand, often presents ideas as facts without testing them. It might use scientific-sounding words but lacks the rigorous process of science. For example, some people claim crystals can heal illnesses, but no controlled studies prove this. Unlike science, pseudoscience doesn’t change when evidence contradicts it. A key difference is testability. Science makes predictions that can be proven wrong, like predicting a solar eclipse. Pseudoscience avoids tests, making claims that can’t be disproven, like saying invisible forces control events. Another clue is consistency. Science builds on past work, like adding bricks to a wall. Pseudoscience ignores or contradicts existing knowledge, like building a wall with random materials. Three related subjects are the history of scientific discoveries, the psychology behind belief in pseudoscience, and how to evaluate claims critically.",
