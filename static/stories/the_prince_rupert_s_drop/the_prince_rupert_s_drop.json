  "clean_story": "Stress distribution.  Thermal tempering.  The Prince Rupert's Drop is a glass object formed by dripping molten glass into cold water.  This process creates a teardrop-shaped piece with a long, thin tail.  The rapid cooling causes the outer layer to solidify quickly, while the interior remains molten longer, leading to high compressive stresses on the surface.  These stresses give the drop its unique properties.  One of the most intriguing aspects of the Prince Rupert's Drop is its ability to withstand significant force on its bulbous end.  The immense compressive stresses on the surface make it surprisingly durable.  However, a slight fracture in the tail can cause the entire structure to disintegrate explosively.  This phenomenon occurs because the release of the internal tensile stresses propagates rapidly through the drop.  The study of the Prince Rupert's Drop has provided insights into the principles of material stress and strength.  It serves as a classic example of how internal stress distribution affects the mechanical properties of materials.  Researchers have used advanced imaging techniques to understand the stress patterns within the drop.  These studies have implications for the development of stronger, more resilient materials.  Three related subjects are thermal shock resistance, fracture mechanics, and tempered glass technology.",
