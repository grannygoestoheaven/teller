  "clean_story": "\"The. Overview. Effect. A. profound. shift. in. perspective. The. term. combines 'overview'—a. broad, comprehensive. view—and 'effect,' the. result. of. that. view. It. describes. the. cognitive. and. emotional. transformation. astronauts. undergo. when. they. see. Earth. from. space. This. phenomenon. was. first. noted. by. psychologist. Frank. White. in 1987, after. observing. common. experiences. among. astronauts. \\n\\nImagine. floating. above. our. planet, seeing. its. fragile. beauty, and. realizing. we're. all. connected. This. sudden, global. perspective. can. be. overwhelming, leading. to. feelings. of. awe, unity, and. responsibility. Astronauts. often. report. a. newfound. appreciation. for. Earth's. ecosystems. and. a. desire. to. protect. them. One. famous. example. is. Apollo 14's. Edgar. Mitchell, who. co-founded. the. Institute. of. Noetic. Sciences. to. study. such. experiences. \\n\\nThe. Overview. Effect. isn't. limited. to. space. Similar. transformations. occur. in. high-altitude. climbers, deep-sea. divers, and. even. those. who. view. Earth. from. tall. buildings. or. drones.
