  "clean_story": "Body systems. Teamwork in motion. The term anatomy comes from Greek anatome, meaning \"to cut apart\"—fitting, since early scientists dissected bodies to map their structures. Physiology (from physis, \"nature\") explains how those structures work together. The human body is often compared to a machine, but it’s more like a city: bones are the steel framework, muscles the construction crews, and blood vessels the highways. Each part has a job, but none works alone. The heart pumps 2, 000 gallons of blood daily, while the lungs swap oxygen for carbon dioxide in seconds—no engine or factory matches this efficiency. Even \"simple\" actions, like lifting a fork, require 34 muscles and 100+ joints coordinating without conscious thought. Take the stomach: its lining renews every 3–5 days to survive its own acid, strong enough to dissolve metal. Or the skin, the body’s largest organ, which sheds 30, 000 cells per minute while sensing temperature, pressure, and pain. These systems adapt constantly—muscles grow with use, bones thicken under stress, and the brain rewires itself when learning new skills. Yet flaws exist. A sneeze can eject droplets at 100 mph, spreading germs faster than a cough. The appendix, once thought useless, now appears to store good bacteria for the gut. Even hiccups, annoying as they are, may be a leftover reflex from our fish ancestors to clear gills. This balance—between precision and quirks—reveals how evolution tinkers rather than designs from scratch. Next steps might explore how animals solve the same problems differently, why some organs can regenerate while others can’t, or how tiny changes in DNA alter entire systems.",
