  "clean": "Atomic number 79. Density and malleability. Single-element purity. Gold, known by its chemical symbol Au, is an element with an atomic number of 79. This places it in group 11 of the periodic table, a category known as the coinage metals. Gold's atomic structure consists of 79 protons and 118 neutrons within its nucleus, surrounded by 79 electrons. These electrons are arranged in a specific electron configuration that contributes to gold's unique properties, such as its resistance to tarnish and its distinctive yellow luster. The electron configuration is [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s1, which highlights its filled d-subshell, a feature that influences its conductivity and malleability. The density of gold is approximately 19. 32 grams per cubic centimeter, making it one of the densest metals. This high density is a result of its atomic mass and the compact arrangement of its atoms. Gold's malleability and ductility are also noteworthy, allowing it to be hammered into thin sheets or drawn into wires without breaking. These physical properties are due to the metallic bonding between gold atoms, where electrons are free to move, providing flexibility and strength. The pure form of gold is often alloyed with other metals to enhance its hardness and durability for various applications. Gold is chemically inert and does not react with most substances, which is why it remains untarnished over time. This inertness is due to its electron configuration, which provides stability and low reactivity. Gold does not oxidize in air or water, and it is resistant to most acids. However, it can be dissolved by aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, which is one of the few substances capable of breaking down gold's structure. This resistance to corrosion is one reason for its historical use in coins, jewelry, and electronics. Gold's purity is measured in karats, with 24 karat gold being pure gold. In its pure state, gold is soft and can be easily shaped, which is why it is often alloyed with other metals like silver, copper, or palladium to improve its hardness. These alloys are used in various industries, from jewelry to electronics, where gold's conductive properties are valued. In addition to its physical and chemical attributes, gold's rarity and aesthetic appeal have made it a symbol of wealth and status throughout history. Three related subjects are the periodic table's transition metals, the process of alloying, and the concept of electron configuration.",
