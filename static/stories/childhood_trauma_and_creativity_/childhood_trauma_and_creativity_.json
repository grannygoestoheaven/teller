  "clean_story": "Pain. Imagination.\nChildhood trauma and creativity are linked by how the brain adapts to hardship.\nTrauma rewires the brain—like a tree growing around a fence. Instead of straight, its branches twist in unexpected ways.\n\nStudies show kids who face adversity often develop stronger imaginative skills. Their brains learn to escape reality by building rich inner worlds. Artists like Frida Kahlo turned pain into vibrant paintings. Musicians like John Lennon channeled loss into songs.\n\nBut it’s not magic—it’s survival. A child’s brain, under stress, seeks control. Creativity becomes a tool to reshape chaos into meaning.\n\nThe cost? Some carry scars for life. Others turn wounds into art.\n\nResilience. The brain’s hidden pathways. Healing through creation.",
