  "clean_story": "Hand gestures. Silent conversations. The term *sign language* refers to structured visual systems that use hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions to convey meaning—just as spoken languages use sounds. <[silence:1200]\n\nMost people think of sign languages as direct translations of spoken words, like spelling letters in the air. But they’re fully independent languages, with their own grammar, slang, and regional accents. For example, American Sign Language (ASL) isn’t just English with hands—it has a unique sentence structure, like placing the object before the verb. If you signed *\"Apple I eat\"* in ASL, it would mean *\"I eat the apple\"* in English. <[silence:1200]\n\nSign languages also rely heavily on space and movement. A signer might assign a spot in the air to represent a person or object, then refer back to it—like placing a toy car on a table and later pointing to it instead of saying *\"the car\"* again. Facial expressions act like punctuation: raised eyebrows can turn a statement into a question, just as your voice rises when asking, *\"You’re coming?\"*<[silence:1200]\n\nThere are hundreds of sign languages worldwide, and they evolve just like spoken ones. British Sign Language (BSL) and ASL differ as much as English and French, even though both countries speak English. Some signs even vary by city, like how people in Boston say *\"car\"* differently than those in Atlanta. Deaf communities also create new signs for modern concepts—like a flat hand tapping the wrist twice for *\"text message\"* or a *\"C\"* handshape near the eye for *\"camera. \"*<[silence:1200]\n\nSign languages aren’t just for the Deaf. They’re used in noisy environments, like construction sites or stock trading floors, where shouting wouldn’t work. Monks in silent orders use them to communicate during vows of silence, and some Indigenous Australian groups developed sign languages to hunt quietly or talk across long distances.
