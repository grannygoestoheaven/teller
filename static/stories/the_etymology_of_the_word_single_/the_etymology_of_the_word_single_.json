  "clean_story": "Origins and evolution. Linguistic influences. The word \"single\" traces its roots to the Latin term \"singulus,\" meaning \"one\" or \"individual. \" This Latin origin highlights the concept of singularity, emphasizing the notion of being alone or distinct. Over time, \"singulus\" evolved into the Old French \"sengle,\" which retained a similar meaning. The transition from Latin to Old French showcases the linguistic journey across cultures and languages. In Middle English, the word transformed into \"single,\" maintaining its core meaning while adapting to the phonetic and grammatical structures of the English language. This adaptation reflects the dynamic nature of language, where words evolve to fit the linguistic context of their time. The word \"single\" has been used in various contexts, from describing an unmarried person to denoting a solitary object. The etymology of \"single\" also reveals the influence of other languages on English. The transition from Latin to Old French and then to Middle English illustrates the interconnectedness of European languages. This interconnectedness is a testament to the historical interactions between different cultures and societies. As languages borrow and adapt words, they enrich their own lexicons and create a tapestry of linguistic diversity. Three related subjects are the evolution of English vocabulary, the influence of Latin on modern languages, and the history of Old French.",
