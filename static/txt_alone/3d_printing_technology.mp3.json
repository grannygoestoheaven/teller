  "clean": "Layered fabrication. Additive manufacturing. Material extrusion. 3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing, involves creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. This process is achieved by layering materials, such as plastics, metals, or resins, to form the desired shape. Unlike traditional manufacturing methods, which often require subtracting material, 3D printing builds objects layer by layer, allowing for intricate designs and reduced waste. The technology has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1980s, with advancements in speed, precision, and material diversity. The applications of 3D printing are vast and varied. In the medical field, it is used to produce custom prosthetics and implants tailored to individual patients. The automotive and aerospace industries employ 3D printing for prototyping and manufacturing lightweight components. Additionally, the technology has found its way into the fashion industry, enabling designers to create unique and complex garments. The ability to rapidly prototype and produce items on-demand has transformed how industries approach production and design. One of the notable benefits of 3D printing is its potential for localized manufacturing. By allowing production at or near the point of consumption, it reduces the need for large-scale shipping and storage. This capability not only lowers transportation costs but also diminishes the environmental impact associated with traditional manufacturing and logistics. Furthermore, 3D printing supports customization, providing consumers with products tailored to their specific needs and preferences. Three related subjects are the development of bioprinting, advancements in sustainable materials for 3D printing, and the impact of 3D printing on intellectual property rights.",
