  "clean_story": "\"Science and morality. Ethics in science. The term 'ethics in science' combines 'ethics,' which means principles of right and wrong, and 'science,' the study of the natural world. Together, they guide researchers to ask: *How should we use our knowledge?*If we are used to think that science is just about discovering facts, but it's just partially true. Science also involves making choices—like whether to share data, how to treat test subjects, or what to do with dangerous discoveries. These choices aren’t just about what’s possible, but what’s *right*. For example, imagine a scientist invents a powerful new drug. They could sell it for profit, but what if only the rich can afford it? Ethics in science asks: *How do we balance innovation with fairness?* Similarly, in experiments with animals or humans, ethics ensures no one is harmed unfairly. Rules like informed consent—where people agree to take part—come from ethical guidelines. Ethics in science also deals with bigger questions, like climate change. Scientists know burning fossil fuels causes harm, but should they speak out? Some argue they have a duty to warn the public, even if it’s controversial. Others worry about being seen as biased. These tensions show that science isn’t neutral—it’s shaped by values. Three related subjects are the balance between progress and responsibility, how society decides what research to fund, and the role of scientists in public debates. \"",
