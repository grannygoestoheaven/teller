It primarily investigates how atoms are arranged in a lattice structure and how this arrangement influences the material's properties.  The study of crystal lattices provides insights into the mechanical, thermal, and electrical behaviors of solids.  Understanding these arrangements helps in predicting how materials will respond under various conditions.  The concept of band gaps is central to solid-state physics.  Band gaps refer to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a solid.  This gap determines a material's electrical conductivity.  Semiconductors, for instance, have a small band gap that allows them to conduct electricity under certain conditions, which is pivotal for electronic devices.  Phonons, or quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice, play a crucial role in thermal conductivity.  They are responsible for the transfer of heat within a material.
