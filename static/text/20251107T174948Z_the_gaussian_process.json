  "clean": "Bayesian inference, kernel functions, stochastic processes.  Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, offering a probabilistic approach to modeling unknown functions.  They are defined as a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.  This enables GPs to provide not only predictions but also uncertainty estimates, making them particularly useful in scenarios where understanding the confidence of predictions is important.  The core of a Gaussian Process lies in its mean function and covariance function, also known as the kernel.  The mean function represents the expected value of the process, while the kernel function encodes assumptions about the function's smoothness and structure.  By choosing different kernels, one can tailor the GP to capture various patterns and relationships in the data.  This flexibility makes GPs highly adaptable to diverse applications, from regression to classification tasks.  One of the distinguishing features of Gaussian Processes is their non-parametric nature.  Unlike parametric models, which are constrained by a fixed number of parameters, GPs adjust their complexity based on the data.  This allows for more nuanced modeling, particularly in cases where the underlying data distribution is complex or not well understood.
