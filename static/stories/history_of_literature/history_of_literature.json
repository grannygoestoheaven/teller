  "clean_story": "**Stories carved in stone. Words that outlive empires.**\n\n*\"Literature\"* comes from Latin *litteratura*—originally meaning \"writing formed with letters,\" later expanding to \"works of imagination or knowledge.\" The name fits: it’s how humans turn thoughts into lasting shapes, first on clay, then paper, now light.\n\nMost think of literature as dusty books or Shakespeare’s plays. But its real power lies in **how it evolves with survival needs**. Early tales weren’t art—they were **instruction manuals for life**. The *Epic of Gilgamesh* (2100 BCE), scratched on clay tablets, warned about hubris by showing a king who loses his best friend to the gods’ punishment. The *Iliad* (800 BCE) wasn’t just a war story—it was a **memory palace** for Greek culture, teaching values through Achilles’ rage and Hector’s nobility. When paper spread from China (105 CE), literature shrank from carvings to scrolls, then books—**speeding up ideas like a river cutting through rock**.\n\nMechanisms shifted with technology:\n- **Oral traditions** (e.g., *Beowulf*) used **repetition and rhythm** to stick in memories—like a song’s chorus.\n- **Printing press (1440)** turned books from luxury to mass tools. Martin Luther’s translated Bible (1534) sold 200,000 copies in 20 years—**proving words could topple empires**.\n- **Novels** (like *Don Quixote*, 1605) mirrored society’s chaos, using **irony and unreliable narrators** to question reality.\n\nPrecision matters: Jane Austen’s *Pride and Prejudice* (1813) dissects class in **dialogue so sharp it feels like surgery**. Hemingway’s iceberg theory (1920s) **hides 90% of the story beneath the surface**, trusting readers to infer—like detecting a shark by its fin.\n\nToday, literature fractures into **hypertext fiction** (choose-your-own-path stories) and **AI-generated prose**, testing what \"authorship\" even means. Yet the core remains: **a tool to compress human experience into portable truth**.\n\nThe silent gaps between words. How metaphors rewire brains. Why some stories refuse to die.",
