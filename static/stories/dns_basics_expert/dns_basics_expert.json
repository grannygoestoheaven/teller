  "clean_story": "Decentralized queries. Hierarchical resolution. The term 'DNS' stands for Domain Name System, a system that translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses. While most people know DNS as the service that helps them reach websites, its inner workings are often misunderstood. \\n\\nDNS operates like a phonebook for the internet, but instead of just looking up names, it does so in a highly optimized way. When you type a URL into your browser, your device doesn’t just ask one server for the answer—it follows a chain of queries, starting with your local cache, then your ISP’s cache, and finally the root servers if needed. This hierarchical approach ensures that even if one part of the system is slow or down, the query can still be resolved. \\n\\nFor example, when you visit a website like 'example. com,' your device first checks its own cache to see if it has a recent record of that domain’s IP address. If not, it asks your ISP’s DNS servers, which might have the answer from a previous request. If that fails, the query moves up the chain to the root servers, which direct it to the authoritative servers for the domain. This process happens in milliseconds, allowing you to access websites almost instantly. \\n\\nDNS also plays a crucial role in load balancing and redundancy. By distributing queries across multiple servers, it ensures that no single point of failure can take down the entire system. This is why DNS is often referred to as the backbone of the internet—it’s what keeps everything connected and running smoothly. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the future of decentralized internet infrastructure, the challenges of maintaining global DNS security, and the creative ways DNS is being used to improve internet performance.",
