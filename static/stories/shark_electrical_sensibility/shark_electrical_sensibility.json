  "clean_story": "Electroreception.  Ampullae of Lorenzini.  Bioelectric fields.  Predatory precision.  Sharks possess a remarkable ability to detect electrical fields in their environment, a sense known as electroreception.  This capability is facilitated by specialized sensory organs called the ampullae of Lorenzini.  These gel-filled pores are located primarily around the shark's head and are highly sensitive to minute electrical signals.  The ampullae of Lorenzini enable sharks to perceive the bioelectric fields generated by other marine organisms, aiding in navigation and prey detection.  The detection of electrical signals plays a significant role in a shark's hunting strategy.  Sharks can sense the weak electrical fields produced by the muscle contractions of their prey, even when concealed under sand or in murky waters.  This ability allows them to locate hidden or camouflaged prey with impressive accuracy.  The sensitivity of the ampullae of Lorenzini is such that sharks can detect voltage gradients as small as a few billionths of a volt per centimeter.  Research has shown that sharks use their electrical sense not only for hunting but also for orientation and navigation.  It is believed that they can detect the Earth's magnetic field, which assists in long-distance migration.  This sensory adaptation is a testament to the evolutionary success of sharks as apex predators in marine ecosystems.  Understanding shark electroreception provides insights into their behavior and ecological roles.  Three related subjects are the role of magnetoreception in animal navigation, the evolution of sensory systems in marine life, and the impact of electromagnetic pollution on aquatic species.",
