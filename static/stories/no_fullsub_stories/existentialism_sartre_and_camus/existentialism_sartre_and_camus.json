  "clean_story": "\"Freedom. Absurdity. Existentialism. The term 'existentialism' combines 'existence' and 'ism,' reflecting its exploration of what it means to live and exist. It emerged in the 20th century, led by philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who grappled with the human condition in a world without inherent meaning. \\n\\nSartre and Camus agreed that life has no predefined purpose, a concept known as 'absurdity. ' Imagine you're in a vast, empty room—life—with no instructions or clear exits. This realization can be distressing, but it also liberates us from societal expectations and allows us to create our own purpose. \\n\\nSartre believed in 'bad faith'—the self-deception we engage in to avoid confronting our freedom. He saw people as 'being-for-itself,' constantly becoming and defining themselves through choices. For instance, a waiter might act overly waiter-like, not because it's his true nature, but to avoid the anxiety of choosing how to be. \\n\\nCamus, however, focused on the 'absurd hero' who embraces the absurdity of life. In his novel 'The Stranger,' the protagonist Meursault faces the absurdity of existence head-on, refusing to lie or conform. Camus argued that this acceptance, not resignation, is the only authentic response to the human condition. \\n\\nBoth philosophers emphasized individual responsibility and authenticity. They challenged us to create our own meaning, even in a meaningless world. Three related subjects are the role of choice in shaping identity, the tension between freedom and responsibility, and the influence of existentialism on literature and art. \"",
