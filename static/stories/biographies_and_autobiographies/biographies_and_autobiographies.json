  "clean_story": "Life stories. Written by self or others. The word biography comes from Greek: bios (life) + graphia (writing). An autobiography adds auto (self), meaning the subject writes their own story. Think of it like the difference between a friend describing your birthday party and you telling it yourself—same events, but the perspective shifts. Biographies act like historical maps. They trace a person’s path—where they were born, what they struggled with, how they changed their field. For example, The Wright Brothers by David McCullough doesn’t just say they invented the airplane; it shows their bike-shop experiments, the 1903 Kitty Hawk winds, and how they funded flights by selling bicycles. Details like their homemade wind tunnel (built from a wooden crate and a fan) reveal the grit behind the glory. Autobiographies, though, are more like diaries with a purpose. Helen Keller’s The Story of My Life doesn’t just recount her blindness and deafness—it describes how she learned to speak by feeling vibrations in her teacher’s throat. She writes, “I did not know then that I was spelling a word… I only knew my fingers were moving.” That moment, aged seven, unlocked her world. Both types rely on proof: letters, interviews, or artifacts. Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs used 40+ interviews to show how Jobs’ adoption shaped his obsession with control—even down to the color of Apple’s circuit boards. Meanwhile, Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings blends memory with poetic rhythm, proving facts can feel like music. The best ones avoid myths. Einstein’s biographies debunk the “failed student” tale—his grades were excellent, but he did skip classes to study physics alone. Autobiographies risk bias (who admits their flaws?), yet Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom admits his early anger, making his later forgiveness more powerful. Some blur the lines. Ghostwritten autobiographies (like many celebrity memoirs) use a hidden writer to shape the subject’s voice. Oral histories, like Studs Terkel’s Working, stitch interviews into collective biographies—revealing how a steelworker’s calloused hands tell a story words might miss. They’re not just about the past. Elon Musk’s Ashlee Vance biography became a Silicon Valley playbook; Malala’s I Am Malala turned a diary into a global education movement. Even fictionalized biopics (The Social Network) spark debates: Did Zuckerberg really say that? Memory’s tricks, missing letters, or deliberate lies can warp the truth. Yet the best stories—like The Diary of Anne Frank—survive because they capture how it felt to live, not just what happened. Ever wonder how a single life can explain an era? Or why some people write their stories while others let historians decide? What gets left out when a life is squeezed into pages?",
