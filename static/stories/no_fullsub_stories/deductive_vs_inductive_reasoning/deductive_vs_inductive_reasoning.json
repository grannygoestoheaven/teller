  "tagged_story_for_tts": "\"Deductive. Inductive. Two reasoning methods, distinct yet complementary. Deductive: top-down, starting with general principles, deriving specific conclusions. Like a pyramid, broad base to narrow tip. 'All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.' Inductive: bottom-up, aggregating specific observations to form broader theories. Like a tree, roots to branches. 'Every swan I've seen is white. Therefore, all swans are likely white.' Trade-off: deductive offers certainty but limited scope; inductive offers breadth but potential error. Edge case: abductive reasoning, middle-ground, using probability to find best explanation. Like Sherlock Holmes' 'eureka' moments.\"",
