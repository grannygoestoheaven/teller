  "clean_story": "Smell triggers memories. Sound rewinds emotions. \"Sensory time travel\" describes how senses—like a whiff of cinnamon or an old song—can instantly teleport you to a past moment, complete with its feelings and details. Your brain doesn’t store memories like files in a folder. It rebuilds them using sensory clues. A 2004 study found that people recalled childhood memories 35% faster when exposed to a scent from that era than when shown photos. Here’s the mechanism:Your olfactory bulb—the smell processor—sits next to the amygdala (emotion center) and hippocampus (memory hub). A single molecule of, say, chlorine might drag you back to a school pool in seconds, heart rate included. Sound works differently. Music activates the auditory cortex and the motor cortex—so a song doesn’t just remind you of a dance; your feet might twitch as if still there. Test it:Play the first 10 seconds of a song from your 15th birthday. Your brain will often fill in the next lyric before it plays—proof the memory isn’t stored as sound, but as a sensory-emotional script. Three related subjects are Proustian memory triggers, how trauma locks in senses, and why déjà vu feels like glitching.",
