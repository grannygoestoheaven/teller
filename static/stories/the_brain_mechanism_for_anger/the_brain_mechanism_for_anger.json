  "clean_story": "Amygdala, prefrontal cortex. The amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure, is pivotal in processing emotions like anger. When a threat is perceived, it activates, sending signals that trigger the body's fight-or-flight response. This activation can lead to increased heart rate and heightened alertness, preparing the body to confront or escape danger. The amygdala's response is rapid, often bypassing rational thought. The prefrontal cortex, located at the brain's front, regulates emotions and impulses. It evaluates the amygdala's signals, helping to manage reactions. In moments of anger, the prefrontal cortex works to assess the situation, aiming to apply reason and control. However, if overwhelmed, its regulatory function can diminish, leading to unrestrained anger. Neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine influence anger regulation. Serotonin modulates mood and aggression, while dopamine is linked to reward and pleasure. Imbalances can affect emotional responses, potentially intensifying anger. Understanding these chemical interactions offers insight into managing anger effectively. Three related subjects are emotional regulation, stress response, and neural pathways of fear.",
