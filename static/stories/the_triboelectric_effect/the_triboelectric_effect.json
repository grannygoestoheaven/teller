  "clean_story": "- Charge separation  - Material interaction  The triboelectric effect occurs when two different materials come into contact and then separate, causing an exchange of electrons.  This electron transfer leads to one material becoming positively charged and the other negatively charged.  The phenomenon is influenced by the nature of the materials involved, such as their surface roughness and chemical composition.  This effect is commonly observed in everyday life, like when a balloon sticks to a wall after being rubbed against hair.  Historically, the triboelectric effect has been known since ancient times, but its scientific exploration began in earnest in the 18th century.  Scientists have developed a triboelectric series, a list ranking materials by their tendency to gain or lose electrons.  This series helps predict the outcome of material interactions.  Despite its long history, the precise mechanisms at the atomic level are still being studied.  In modern applications, the triboelectric effect is harnessed in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.  These devices have potential in sustainable energy solutions, powering small electronics through everyday motions.
