  "clean": "Photon mapping.  Global illumination.  Caustics.  Radiance estimation.  Photon mapping is a two-pass global illumination algorithm used in 3D computer graphics to simulate the way light interacts with surfaces.  The first pass involves tracing photons from a light source into the scene, where they may be absorbed, reflected, or refracted.  These interactions are stored in a photon map, which is essentially a data structure containing information about the direction, position, and power of each photon.  This data is crucial for accurately simulating complex lighting effects such as caustics and color bleeding.  The second pass of photon mapping involves rendering the scene using the stored photon map to estimate radiance at various points.  This is achieved by gathering nearby photons and calculating their contribution to the lighting at a given point.  This method allows for the simulation of realistic lighting effects that are difficult to achieve with traditional ray tracing alone.  The radiance estimation step is key to producing images with nuanced and detailed lighting.  Photon mapping is particularly effective for scenes with complex light interactions, such as those involving transparent or highly reflective surfaces.  It offers a balance between computational efficiency and visual accuracy, making it a popular choice in rendering engines for realistic image synthesis.  While not as fast as some other methods, its ability to handle intricate lighting scenarios makes it valuable in fields requiring high-quality visual output.
