  "clean": "State transitions.  Deterministic behavior.  Computational models.  A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to design algorithms and computational processes.  It consists of a finite number of states, transitions between these states, and actions.  Each state represents a condition or situation in which the machine can be.  Transitions occur based on inputs, leading the machine from one state to another.  This model is particularly useful in designing digital circuits, parsing, and control systems.  FSMs are classified into two main types: deterministic finite automata (DFA) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA).  In a DFA, each state has exactly one transition for each possible input.  This ensures predictable behavior and simplifies implementation.  NFAs, on the other hand, can have multiple transitions for a given input, allowing for greater flexibility in design.  Despite their differences, both types are equivalent in terms of computational power.  The application of FSMs extends to various fields, including software engineering and artificial intelligence.  In software engineering, FSMs are used to model the behavior of systems and processes, ensuring that they operate correctly under different conditions.  In artificial intelligence, FSMs can be used to model decision-making processes and automate tasks.  By breaking down complex processes into manageable states and transitions, FSMs provide a clear framework for understanding and designing systems.
