  "clean_story": "Time’s flow. Our perception of it. The word 'time' comes from an Old English term meaning 'a measure of duration. ' But is it a real thing, or just how our brains interpret events?We often think of time as a river, moving forward in a straight line. But scientists and philosophers debate whether time is an illusion created by our minds or a fundamental part of the universe. Imagine standing on a train. To you, the train is moving forward, but to someone on the platform, you’re standing still. This is similar to how time can feel different depending on your perspective. Some theories suggest that time doesn’t actually flow like we think it does. Instead, it might be more like a snapshot, with past, present, and future all existing at once. This idea comes from physics, where time is treated as a dimension, like height or width. In this view, time is a way for us to organize events, but it doesn’t have an independent existence. Think of it like a movie. Each frame is a moment in time, but the film itself doesn’t move—it’s our brains that create the illusion of motion. Similarly, time might just be our way of making sense of the sequence of events around us. But other theories argue that time is very real. For example, the laws of physics describe how things change over time, and these changes seem to happen in a consistent order. If time were just an illusion, why do we all experience it moving in the same direction? Three related subjects are the nature of reality, the physics of spacetime, and how our brains perceive the passage of time.",
