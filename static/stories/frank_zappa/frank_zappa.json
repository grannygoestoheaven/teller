Satire with guitars. \"Frank Zappa\" wasn\u2019t a stage name\u2014it was his real one, though his Greek-Italian roots gave him the full Francis Vincent Zappa. He treated rock bands like jazz ensembles, writing sheets of music where others improvised three chords. At 14, he taught himself orchestration by transcribing Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring\u2014note by note\u2014from a record player. By 22, he\u2019d recorded Freak Out!, a double album mocking pop culture while weaving doo-wop, avant-garde noise, and political rants into 45 minutes. His tool?The Synclavier, an early digital sampler he used to compose entire orchestral pieces on a computer in 1982\u2014when most musicians still feared synthesizers. Zappa\u2019s guitar solos weren\u2019t \"played\"they were assembled:he stitched together fragments from multiple takes, splicing tape with razor blades to build impossible runs. Live, he\u2019d cue band members with hand signals like a traffic cop, shifting tempos mid-song just to mess with the audience. His 1971 film 200 Motels featured Ringo Starr as \"Larry the Dwarf\"and a score so complex the orchestra quit halfway through recording. He testified before Congress in 1985 against music censorship, calling tipper stickers \"a consumer fraud. \"Three related subjects are tape music experiments, jazz fusion\u2019s rule-breaking, and how satire shapes protest art.", "timestamp": "20260228T231444Z"}
