  "clean_story": "Endless curiosity.  Rapid growth engines. \"Kid\" comes from Old Norse kið—meaning \"young goat,\" mirroring their boundless energy and knack for exploring untamed spaces. They’re often seen as mini-adults in training, but their brains operate like high-speed laboratories. Neural connections form at 1 million per second in early childhood—like a city building roads faster than maps can track. This isn’t random growth:Every question (\"Why is the sky blue?\") or experiment (dropping toys to test gravity) rewires pathways, shaping how they’ll solve problems later. Take language:A 3-year-old’s brain distinguishes sounds in any language—until it prunes unused circuits by age 7, specializing in their native tongue. Or risk-taking:Climbing trees or roughhousing isn’t recklessness; it’s calibration, teaching their bodies limits and resilience. Even \"annoying\" traits serve purposes. Repetitive questions? That’s pattern-recognition software running. Short attention spans? A survival tool—scanning for novel threats or opportunities, like ancestral foragers. Three related subjects are childhood neuroplasticity, play as survival training, and how cultures shape learning speeds.",
