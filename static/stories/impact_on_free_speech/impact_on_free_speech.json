  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Words without walls.\nVoices that shape laws.\n\n\"Free speech\" means saying what you think without the government stopping you—like shouting in a park instead of whispering in a library. The idea comes from old rules (like the U.S. First Amendment in 1791) that said governments can’t jail people just for speaking.\n\nBut free speech isn’t simple. It’s like a game with rules: you can criticize a leader, but not yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater if there’s no fire. Courts decide where the line is. In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court said speech is protected unless it’s likely to cause \"imminent lawless action\"—like telling a mob to burn down a building right now.\n\nTechnology changed the game. Social media lets billions talk at once, but companies like Facebook or X (Twitter) set their own rules. They can ban hate speech or misinformation, but who decides what’s \"hate\"? In 2021, Twitter banned former President Trump for posts it said could incite violence. Some cheered; others called it censorship.\n\nFree speech also clashes with safety. In 2017, white nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting racist slogans. The city tried to stop them, but courts said the march was protected speech—even if it was ugly. The line between \"free\" and \"dangerous\" keeps moving.\n\nAround the world, the rules differ. In Germany, denying the Holocaust is illegal. In China, criticizing the government can land you in prison. In India, laws against \"hurting religious feelings\" have been used to arrest comedians. What’s \"free\" in one place is a crime in another.\n\nThe internet made speech global, but laws are still local. A tweet legal in the U.S. might get you arrested in Turkey. Courts and companies are still figuring out how to handle this.\n\nFree speech isn’t just about talking—it’s about power. Who gets to speak? Who gets silenced? And who decides?\n\nPublic squares.\nAlgorithms.\nBorders.",
