  "clean_story": "Gravity’s rules. Quantum chaos.\n\"Quantum gravity\" names the missing link between Einstein’s smooth spacetime and the jagged, unpredictable quantum world.\n\nImagine a trampoline with a bowling ball—it bends the fabric. That’s gravity as we know it. Now shrink the ball to a speck smaller than an atom. The trampoline rips—or vanishes into pixels.\n\nAt tiny scales, gravity refuses to play by quantum rules. Particles pop in and out of existence, warping space in ways equations can’t predict. Black holes hum with \"Hawking radiation,\" but no one knows how it escapes their crushing pull.\n\nTwo tools hunt answers: Loop quantum gravity (space as woven threads) and string theory (vibrating strings instead of particles). Neither has proof—yet.\n\nThe puzzle? A theory must explain a black hole’s last gasp and why your coffee cup stays put. Until then, gravity remains the universe’s quiet rebel.\n\nThree related subjects are black hole information paradox, Planck-scale experiments, and emergent spacetime theories.",
