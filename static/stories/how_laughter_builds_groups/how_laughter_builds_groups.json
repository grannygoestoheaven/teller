  "clean_story": "Shared giggles.  Instant team glue. \"Laughter\" comes from the Old English hleahtor—a sound that bursts out when something surprises or delights us, like a pressure valve for joy. Most see laughter as just fun. But it’s a biological shortcut—like a handshake for brains. When a group laughs together, their breath syncs, their heartbeats align, and their brains release endorphins—the same chemicals that bond runners after a race. Here’s how it works:A joke lands. —Your brain predicts the punchline in 0. 2 seconds. If the group laughs, your mirror neurons fire, copying their expressions before you even realize why. It’s like a choir tuning up—no conductor needed. Studies show groups that laugh together solve puzzles 30% faster. Not because they’re smarter—but because laughter reduces fear of failure. Example:Improv comedians use a rule called \"Yes, and. .. \"—No idea is rejected. Laughter signals safety, so risks feel smaller. Even fake laughter works. In experiments, groups told to force-laugh for 10 minutes later rated each other as more trustworthy. The brain can’t tell forced from real—it just hears \"We’re safe. We’re connected. \"Three related subjects are mirror neuron mechanics, group flow states, and why humor evolves in social animals.",
