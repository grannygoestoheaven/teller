  "clean": "Retinal mosaic.  Phototransduction cascade.  Neural signal transmission.  Visual cortex processing.  The human eye begins its precise mechanism with the cornea and lens focusing light onto the retina.  The retina, a delicate layer of photoreceptor cells, captures this light.  These photoreceptors, rods, and cones, initiate the phototransduction cascade.  This cascade converts light into electrical signals.  These electrical signals are then transmitted through the optic nerve.  The optic nerve acts as a conduit, carrying the signals to the brain.  Within the brain, the signals reach the lateral geniculate nucleus.  Here, they undergo initial processing before advancing to the visual cortex.  In the visual cortex, located in the occipital lobe, the signals are interpreted into coherent images.  This region deciphers aspects such as shape, color, and motion.  The process requires precise coordination and timing.  The result is the perception of a seamless visual experience.
