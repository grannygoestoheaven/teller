  "clean": "Memory retrieval, emotional regulation.  \n  Nostalgia, a complex emotional experience, often involves a longing for the past.  It can be triggered by sensory stimuli such as music or scents, which evoke vivid memories.  Recent studies suggest that nostalgia serves as a psychological buffer against stress and loneliness.  By recalling cherished memories, individuals can foster a sense of continuity and meaning in their lives.    The role of nostalgia in emotional regulation is significant.  When individuals engage in nostalgic reflection, they often experience increased self-esteem and optimism.  This process can mitigate feelings of anxiety and depression, providing a temporary emotional uplift.  Nostalgia's ability to enhance social connectedness is also noteworthy, as it often involves shared experiences with others.    Memory retrieval is another aspect of nostalgia that warrants attention.  Nostalgic memories are typically more detailed and emotionally charged than ordinary memories.  This heightened detail can be attributed to the brain's selective retrieval processes, which prioritize emotionally significant events.  Such memories can reinforce personal identity and provide a sense of stability in times of change.    Three related subjects are the impact of nostalgia on decision-making, the role of nostalgia in marketing, and the effects of nostalgia on creativity.",
