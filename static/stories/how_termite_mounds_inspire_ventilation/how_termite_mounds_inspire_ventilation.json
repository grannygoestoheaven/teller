Nature\u2019s silent air conditioners. \"Termite mound\" describes the towering, clay-built nests where millions of termites live\u2014yet their real genius is invisible. Inside, a labyrinth of tunnels and chimneys works like a building\u2019s HVAC, but without electricity. Here\u2019s the mechanism:Hot air rises from the nest\u2019s core,  pulling fresh oxygen down through porous walls. At night, cooler outside air sinks into lower chambers,  flushing out carbon dioxide. The secret?The mound\u2019s spongy, moisture-rich clay\u2014it absorbs heat by day,  releases it at night. Like a desert canteen sweating to stay cool. Architects now mimic this. Zimbabwe\u2019s Eastgate Centre uses termite-inspired vents and thermal mass,  slashing energy costs by 90%.
