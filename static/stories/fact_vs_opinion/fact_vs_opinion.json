  "clean_story": "\"Facts are verifiable. Opinions are subjective. The term 'fact' comes from the Latin 'factum,' meaning something done or made, while 'opinion' stems from 'opinio,' meaning belief or judgment. Facts are statements that can be proven true or false, like 'The Earth orbits the Sun. ' Opinions, however, are personal views, like 'Sunrises are the most beautiful part of the day. ' Facts rely on evidence, such as scientific data or historical records, while opinions are shaped by individual experiences and perspectives. For example, the fact that 'Water boils at 100°C at sea level' is universally accepted, but whether someone prefers tea or coffee is purely an opinion. Facts provide a foundation for understanding the world, while opinions add color and diversity to human thought. Three related subjects are the role of evidence in science, the influence of bias on opinions, and how facts and opinions shape public discourse. \"",
