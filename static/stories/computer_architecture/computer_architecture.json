  "clean_story": "**Blueprints for machines. Rules for speed and logic. \"Computer architecture\" describes how a machine’s parts are organized to follow instructions—like a city’s layout dictating how traffic, power, and people move efficiently. Most people think of computers as just \"fast calculators,\" but their real power comes from how they’re built. Imagine a kitchen: a bad layout forces you to walk across the room for every spoon or ingredient, but a smart one puts everything within reach. Computer architecture does this for data. It decides where information lives (memory), how it travels (buses), and who does the work (CPU, GPU). Take the **von Neumann architecture**, the standard since 1945. It stores programs *and* data in the same memory, so the CPU fetches instructions like a chef reading a recipe while cooking. Before this, machines like the **ENIAC** had to be physically rewired for new tasks—like swapping out a typewriter for every letter. Von Neumann’s design cut that time from hours to milliseconds. Modern tricks push this further. **Pipelining** splits tasks into steps, like an assembly line: while one instruction is being executed, the next is already being fetched. **Caching** keeps frequently used data close, like keeping your phone in your pocket instead of a backpack. Without these, your laptop would stall like a car idling at every stop sign. Even \"simple\" devices rely on this. A **Raspberry Pi** uses an **ARM architecture**, designed for low power but fast enough to run a media center or robot. Supercomputers like **Fugaku** stack thousands of CPUs with ultra-fast connections, solving weather models in hours instead of weeks. The choices aren’t just about speed—they shape what’s possible. A GPU’s **parallel architecture** lets it render 3D graphics by handling thousands of tiny math problems at once, while a CPU focuses on one complex task. That’s why your phone can play *Genshin Impact* but struggles to edit 4K video. Quantum computing flips the script entirely. Instead of bits (0 or 1), it uses **qubits** that can be both at once, like a spinning coin. This could crack codes or simulate molecules in ways today’s architectures can’t. Memory hierarchies. Instruction sets. The balance between heat, speed, and cost.",
