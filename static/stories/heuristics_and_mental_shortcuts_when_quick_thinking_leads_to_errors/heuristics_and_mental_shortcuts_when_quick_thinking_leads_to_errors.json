  "clean_story": "Quick decisions. Mental shortcuts speed them up. Heuristics are like mental shortcuts that help us make decisions faster, but they can sometimes lead to mistakes. Imagine you’re in a hurry and need to choose between two restaurants. Instead of researching each one, you pick the one with the longer line, assuming it must be better because more people are choosing it. This is a heuristic—it’s a quick rule of thumb that often works, but not always. For example, you might choose a restaurant with a long line because it seems popular, only to find out the food is actually mediocre. Another common heuristic is the \"availability heuristic,\" where you judge the likelihood of something based on how easily you can think of examples. If you’ve recently heard about several plane crashes, you might overestimate the risk of flying, even though statistically, it’s very safe. These shortcuts can save time, but they can also lead to errors when the situation is more complex than the heuristic accounts for. Three related subjects are cognitive biases, the psychology of decision-making, and how our brains process information under pressure.",
