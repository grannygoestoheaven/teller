  "clean_story": "**Heuristics and errors. Mental shortcuts. **\nThe word 'heuristic' comes from the Greek word 'heuriskein,' meaning 'to find' or 'to discover. ' Heuristics are like mental shortcuts our brains use to make quick decisions. They’re useful because they help us process information faster, but they can also lead to mistakes. Imagine you’re at a buffet and you see a dish that looks delicious. Instead of analyzing every ingredient, you might just think, 'It looks good, so it must be tasty. ' That’s a heuristic in action. But sometimes, these shortcuts can trick us. For example, if you always assume that expensive products are better, you might end up paying more for something that isn’t necessarily superior. One common heuristic is the 'availability heuristic,' where we judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall examples of it. If you hear about a plane crash on the news, you might start thinking that flying is dangerous, even though statistically, it’s very safe. Another example is the 'representative heuristic,' where we assume something is true because it fits a stereotype. If you meet someone who loves math and is quiet, you might assume they’re good at programming, even if that’s not always the case. Heuristics aren’t all bad—they help us navigate the world efficiently. But being aware of them can help us avoid common pitfalls. Three related subjects are cognitive biases, the science of decision-making, and how our brains process information.",
