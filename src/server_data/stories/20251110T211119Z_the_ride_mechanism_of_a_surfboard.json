  "clean": "Buoyancy.  Hydrodynamics.  Surface tension.  The ride mechanism of a surfboard is a fascinating interplay of physics and design.  At its core, buoyancy allows the surfboard to float, a result of the board's volume displacing water equal to its weight.  This floating ability is crucial in maintaining the board's position on the water surface.  The shape and volume distribution of the surfboard are meticulously crafted to optimize this buoyancy.  Hydrodynamics plays a significant role in the surfboard's movement.  The board's rocker, or the curve from nose to tail, influences how water flows underneath, affecting speed and maneuverability.  A flatter rocker enhances speed on smaller waves, while a more pronounced rocker aids in turning on larger waves.  The fin setup further stabilizes the board, guiding its direction and control.  Surface tension between the board and water contributes to the ride experience.  The wax applied to the surfboard's surface increases grip, preventing the surfer from slipping off.  This interaction is pivotal in maintaining balance and control during a ride.  The board's rails, or edges, are designed to cut through water efficiently, aiding in turns and maintaining speed.
