  "clean_story": "Cosmology. The study of the universe. The term 'cosmology' comes from the Greek words 'kosmos' (universe) and 'logia' (study). It’s the scientific exploration of the universe’s origin, structure, and evolution. Cosmology isn’t just about distant galaxies or black holes. It’s about understanding the fundamental laws that govern everything, from the smallest particles to the largest cosmic structures. Imagine trying to piece together a puzzle with trillions of pieces, where most are invisible or hidden in plain sight. That’s what cosmologists do. One key tool in cosmology is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the afterglow of the Big Bang. By studying its patterns, scientists can infer the universe’s age, composition, and expansion rate. It’s like reading the universe’s fingerprint to uncover its history. Cosmology also explores dark matter and dark energy, which make up about 95% of the universe but can’t be seen or directly detected. Their existence is inferred through their gravitational effects, like seeing a shadow but not the object casting it. These mysterious components shape the universe’s fate, determining whether it will expand forever or collapse. Three related subjects are the search for extraterrestrial life, the nature of black holes, and the quest to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. \"",
