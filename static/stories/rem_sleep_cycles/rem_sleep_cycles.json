Memory\u2019s backstage pass.\n\"REM\" stands for rapid eye movement\u2014the phase where your eyes dart under closed lids, like scanning a dream\u2019s invisible script.\nMost call it the \"dream stage,\" but REM is the brain\u2019s file-sorting mode. While deep sleep stores facts like a hard drive, REM\u2014\n\u2014rewires emotions, trims useless memories, and rehearses skills without you lifting a finger. Here\u2019s the mechanism: Your brainstem fires signals to the cortex, flooding it with random snippets\u2014\u2014a childhood smell, a missed step, a face you\u2019ve never seen. The cortex stitches these into stories, testing connections like a musician improvising riffs. Proof? Rats learning a maze replay the route in REM, faster than real time. Humans deprived of REM forget procedures\u2014like piano scales\u2014but recall trivia just fine. Timing matters: First REM cycle lasts 10 minutes; by dawn, it stretches to an hour. Your brain prioritizes what to keep\u2014like a editor cutting film. Three related subjects are sleep spindle bursts, lucid dreaming triggers, and how whales skip REM.", "timestamp": "20260301T103204Z"}
