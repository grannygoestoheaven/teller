  "clean_story": "\"Hidden dangers. Lies for profit. \"\n\nAn industrial cover-up is when companies hide mistakes or risks—like burying evidence—to avoid trouble or keep making money.\n\nMost people think of scandals as rare, explosive events. But cover-ups often start small: a ignored safety report, a deleted email, a worker told to stay quiet.\nIn 1984, Union Carbide’s pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, leaked toxic gas. Official records later showed alarms were turned off, safety systems failed, and warnings were ignored for months. Over 3,800 died in days. The company first blamed \"sabotage,\" then paid families $470 each—about a year’s wage—to settle claims.\n\nOr take asbestos. By the 1930s, doctors confirmed it caused lung disease. Yet companies like Johns-Manville hid reports for decades, even hosting \"dust parties\" where workers tossed asbestos in the air like confetti. Internal memos from 1966 called health concerns \"a snowball rolling downhill\"—but they sold $2 billion worth anyway.\n\nCover-ups rely on three tools: delay (drag out lawsuits until victims give up), distraction (blame \"bad apples\" or \"unforeseen events\"), and document destruction (shredding, \"lost\" files, or digital deletions).\n\nThe cost? Beyond lives, trust erodes. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, BP’s stock dropped 52% in 40 days. Volkswagen’s \"dieselgate\" emissions fraud cost $30 billion in fines—and their \"honest brand\" reputation.\n\nWhistleblowers, leaked data, and stubborn journalists crack these cases. But for every exposure, others stay buried.\nSilence as a strategy. Profit over people. The math of denial.",
