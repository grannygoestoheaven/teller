  "clean_story": "\"Time travel paradoxes. Logical consistency. The Chronology Protection Conjecture combines 'chronos'—time—and 'protection. ' It suggests that the universe shields itself from paradoxes caused by time travel. In other words, it's like a built-in safety feature preventing logical contradictions. \\n\\nImagine you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, preventing your own birth. How could you then exist to go back in time? This is the classic grandfather paradox. The conjecture proposes that such scenarios are impossible, or would create a new timeline, preserving consistency. \\n\\nPhysicist Stephen Hawking popularized this idea in 1992. He argued that if time travel were possible, it would have already happened, creating paradoxes we'd see today. Since we don't, he concluded the universe must prevent them. \\n\\nOne way this might work is through 'novikov self-consistency principle. ' It suggests that any action taken in the past must be part of the original timeline. So, if you went back and tried to change something, you'd fail, or your actions would be part of what was always meant to happen. \\n\\nAnother idea is 'many-worlds interpretation,' where time travel creates parallel universes. In this scenario, changing the past doesn't affect your original timeline. Instead, it creates a new one. \\n\\nThree related subjects are the physics of time travel, the philosophical implications of changing the past, and the role of free will in a universe that protects its own consistency. \"",
