  "clean_story": "Science. A way to understand the world. The word 'science' comes from the Latin 'scientia,' meaning 'knowledge. ' It’s a systematic approach to discovering how things work, using observation and experimentation. If we are used to think that science is just about memorizing facts, but it's just partially true. Science is a process, not just a collection of answers. It starts with curiosity—asking questions like 'Why does the sky change color at sunset?' or 'How do plants grow?' Scientists then make educated guesses, called hypotheses, to explain these questions. They test these guesses through experiments, collecting data to see if their ideas hold up. If the data supports the hypothesis, it becomes a theory, like the theory of gravity. If not, scientists refine their ideas and try again. This cycle of asking, testing, and refining is the scientific method. It’s like solving a puzzle by trying different pieces until they fit. Science isn’t about being right the first time—it’s about getting closer to the truth with each attempt. Three related subjects are the history of groundbreaking discoveries, the role of failure in innovation, and how science shapes our understanding of the universe.",
