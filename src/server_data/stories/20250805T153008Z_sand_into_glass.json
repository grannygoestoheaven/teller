  "subject": "sand into glass",
  "raw": "Did you know that sand can transform into glass with the touch of lightning? \n\nFirst, imagine grains of sand, each one tiny and rough. When intense heat, like that from a lightning strike or a furnace, hits these grains, they begin to melt. The sand becomes a glowing liquid, shimmering with potential. As it cools, this liquid solidifies into glass, smooth and transparent, capturing light in a way sand never could.\n\nPicture a beach during a storm. A bolt of lightning strikes the sand, and in that brief moment, the heat is so powerful that it fuses the sand into a glassy tube called a fulgurite. It's nature's own sculpture, hidden beneath the surface, a testament to the transformation.\n\nThree related subjects are: volcanic glass, glassblowing, and silica.",
