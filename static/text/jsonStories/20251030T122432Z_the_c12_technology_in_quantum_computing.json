  "clean": "Carbon nanotubes. Quantum coherence. Scalability.  The C12 technology in quantum computing is a pioneering approach that utilizes carbon nanotubes to enhance the performance and scalability of quantum processors.  Carbon-12, a stable isotope of carbon, is employed due to its ability to minimize decoherence, a major challenge in quantum computing.  By leveraging the unique properties of carbon nanotubes, C12 technology aims to create qubits that maintain coherence over longer periods, thereby improving computational reliability.  This technology stands out because of its focus on material science to address quantum computing challenges.  Carbon nanotubes offer a high degree of purity and structural integrity, which are essential for maintaining quantum states.  The use of these nanotubes allows for the development of qubits that are less susceptible to environmental noise, a common issue that affects quantum systems.  As a result, C12 technology has the potential to significantly advance the field by providing a more stable platform for quantum computation.  Scalability is another key advantage of the C12 technology.  The inherent properties of carbon nanotubes enable the creation of densely packed qubit arrays, which are crucial for building larger quantum systems.  This scalability is achieved without compromising the coherence of the qubits, making it a promising solution for developing practical quantum computers.  The ability to produce large-scale quantum processors with high fidelity is a significant step forward in the quest for quantum supremacy.
