The language of bees, often referred to as the \"waggle dance,\" is a sophisticated method of communication used primarily by honeybees.  This dance involves a series of movements that convey specific information about the location of resources such as nectar and pollen.  The angle of the dance in relation to the sun communicates direction, while the duration of the waggle phase indicates distance.  This method allows bees to efficiently share critical information with their hive mates.  In addition to the waggle dance, bees utilize pheromones as a chemical means of communication.
