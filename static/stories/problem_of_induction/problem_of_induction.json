  "clean_story": "**Inductive reasoning. Guessing the future. **\nThe term 'induction' comes from 'induce,' meaning to infer or conclude. It’s like predicting the next number in a sequence based on the ones you’ve seen. Induction is how we learn from experience. If every swan you’ve seen is white, you might assume all swans are white. But this can lead to mistakes, like when black swans were discovered in Australia. The problem of induction is that past observations don’t guarantee future outcomes. Just because something has always happened a certain way doesn’t mean it always will. For example, you might think the sun will rise tomorrow because it always has, but induction alone can’t prove it. Science relies on induction to build theories, but it also knows those theories can be revised. Three related subjects are the limits of human knowledge, the philosophy of science, and the role of probability in decision-making.",
