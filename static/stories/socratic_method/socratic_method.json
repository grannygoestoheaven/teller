  "clean_story": "\"Questioning. Seeking truth. The word 'Socratic' comes from Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher. He used questions to help people think deeply and find their own answers. Imagine you’re trying to solve a puzzle, but instead of giving you the answer, someone asks you questions to guide you toward the solution. That’s the Socratic method. It’s like a game of intellectual detective work, where the goal is to uncover the truth through careful questioning. \\nThe Socratic method isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about asking the right questions to stimulate critical thinking and self-discovery. Socrates believed that by questioning assumptions and exploring ideas, people could arrive at a deeper understanding of the world. \\nFor example, if you’re trying to understand what makes a good friend, the Socratic method might involve asking questions like, 'What qualities do you value in a friend?' or 'How do you know if someone is truly a good friend?' These questions help you think more carefully about the topic and come to your own conclusions. \\nThe Socratic method is still used today in education and philosophy. It’s a powerful tool for teaching because it encourages students to think for themselves rather than just memorizing facts. It’s also used in legal settings, where lawyers might use a similar approach to uncover the truth in a case. \\nThree related subjects are critical thinking, the history of philosophy, and the art of asking insightful questions. \"",
