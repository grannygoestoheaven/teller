  "clean_story": "\"Scarcity. Abundance. The phrase 'supply and demand' describes how much of something is available and how much people want it. It’s like a seesaw: when one side goes up, the other goes down. If something is rare, people will pay more for it, but if there’s too much, prices drop. Imagine a toy that everyone wants but only a few are made—its price will soar. But if the same toy is mass-produced, its price will fall because there’s enough for everyone. This balance shapes everything from groceries to electronics. For example, during a drought, water becomes scarce, so its price rises. Conversely, when farmers harvest too many apples, their price drops because there are too many to sell. Supply and demand also affect jobs—if many people want to be doctors, salaries stay high, but if too many people become teachers, salaries may drop. Understanding this helps businesses set prices and plan production. Three related subjects are how inflation changes prices, the role of competition in markets, and why some products always stay expensive. \"",
