  "clean": "Singleton.  Observer.  Factory Method.  These are not merely terms but represent the cornerstone of software design patterns.  Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is a seminal work authored by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.  Published in 1994, it introduced a catalog of 23 classic design patterns that have since become a foundation for software engineers.  The book categorizes these patterns into three types: creational, structural, and behavioral.  Each pattern addresses a specific problem in software design, providing a template for solving it efficiently.  The authors meticulously describe each pattern with its intent, applicability, structure, and consequences.  For instance, the Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing changes in one object to be automatically reflected in others.  The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.  The impact of this work is profound, as it has shaped the way software is designed and developed.  By promoting reusable solutions, it has improved the efficiency and maintainability of software systems.  Three related subjects are software architecture, agile methodologies, and object-oriented programming.",
