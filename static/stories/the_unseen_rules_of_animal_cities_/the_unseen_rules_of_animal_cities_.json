  "clean_story": "Hidden hierarchies. Silent cooperation.\n\n\"Animal cities\" describes how groups like ants, bees, or meerkats organize themselves—without mayors, laws, or meetings—using invisible rules.\n\nTake leafcutter ants. A single colony farms fungus like a human city runs farms—but no ant \"assigns\" jobs. Smaller workers cut leaves. Medium ones carry. Largest defend. Their size automatically decides their role, like a conveyor belt where the part’s shape dictates its function.\n\nNaked mole-rats dig tunnels in a pattern: one \"queen\" breeds, others either dig or guard, switching tasks if the queen dies. No elections. The change happens when workers smell her absence—chemistry, not votes, picks the new leader.\n\nEven fish follow rules. Schools turn in unison because each fish watches its seven nearest neighbors. No leader. Just math: if 51% of those seven swerve left, you swerve left. A city’s traffic lights, but built from instinct.\n\nNo memos. No police. Just size, scent, and simple reactions—scaled up, they build skyscrapers (termite mounds), farms (ant fungus), and highways (elephant paths).\n\nSwarm intelligence in robots.\nHuman cities copying ant traffic.\nHow smell could replace passwords.",
