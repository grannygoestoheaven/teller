  "clean_story": "Calcium carbonate, volatile compounds. Ashes, the residue left after combustion, consist of a complex mix of minerals and elements. Predominantly, they contain calcium carbonate, derived from the breakdown of organic materials. This compound, along with oxides of silicon, aluminum, and iron, forms the bulk of ash content. These minerals contribute to the structural integrity and chemical properties of the ash. Trace elements such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus are also present, albeit in smaller quantities. These elements play a role in the nutrient cycle when ashes are returned to the soil. The presence of volatile compounds, including sulfates and chlorides, can influence the ash's reactivity and environmental impact. Moisture content and particle size affect the physical characteristics of ash. These factors determine the ash's behavior in various applications, from agriculture to construction. Understanding these properties aids in optimizing its use and mitigating any adverse effects. Three related subjects are soil amendment, combustion by-products, and mineral recycling.",
