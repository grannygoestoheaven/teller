  "clean_story": "\"Life beyond Earth. Aliens are hypothetical beings from other planets. \"\n\nThe word \"alien\" comes from Latin alius, meaning \"other\" or \"strange. \" It fits because these beings would be unlike anything we know.\n\nMost people imagine aliens as little green humans with big eyes. But scientists think real aliens—if they exist—could be microscopic bacteria or giant floating creatures in gas planets.\nOn Earth, life thrives in extreme places: boiling vents, frozen deserts, even nuclear waste. If life can survive here, why not on Mars’ underground lakes or Europa’s icy oceans?\nNASA’s rovers search for fossilized microbes in Martian rocks. Telescopes scan distant planets for oxygen or methane—gases that might hint at life.\nNo proof exists yet. But the universe has 2 trillion galaxies. Statistically, we’re probably not alone.\n\nThree related subjects are exoplanet atmospheres, extremophile life, and Fermi’s paradox.",
