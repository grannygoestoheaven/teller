  "clean_story": "Conflict on stage. Emotions in motion. The word *drama* comes from the Greek *dran*, meaning \"to do\" or \"to act. \" It’s not just about loud arguments—it’s about *action* that reveals deeper truths, like turning over a rock to see what crawls underneath. Drama is often mistaken for melodrama—exaggerated tears, shouting, or over-the-top reactions. But real drama is quieter, sharper. Think of a chess match where every move changes the game, or a conversation where a single paused sentence shifts the power between two people. The tension comes from *what isn’t said* as much as what is. In theater, drama relies on **three tools**: dialogue, silence, and subtext. Dialogue is the words spoken, but subtext is the hidden meaning beneath them—like a smile that doesn’t reach the eyes. Silence, when used right, forces the audience to lean in. A classic example is *Death of a Salesman*, where Willy Loman’s rambling about success hides his fear of being forgotten. His family’s quiet responses say more than any speech. Drama isn’t just for plays. It’s in courtrooms, where a lawyer’s pause before revealing evidence can sway a jury. It’s in sports, when a player’s glare after a foul tells a story without words. Even in daily life, drama unfolds when a text message goes unanswered, or a door slams just a little too hard. The best drama makes you *feel* the stakes, whether it’s a king’s downfall or a child lying about a broken vase. It’s not about volume—it’s about precision. A whispered threat can cut deeper than a scream. Tragedy and comedy, power struggles, the gap between who we are and who we pretend to be. The stage or the street, the difference is just the lighting.",
