  "clean": "Olfactory receptors.  Neural pathways.  Limbic system connections.  Pheromones.  Odor memories.  The sense of smell, or olfaction, begins with olfactory receptors located in the nasal cavity.  These receptors detect airborne molecules and send signals to the brain for processing.  Humans possess approximately 400 types of olfactory receptors, each sensitive to different odor molecules.  This diversity allows for the detection of a vast array of scents.  Once the olfactory receptors capture scent molecules, the signals travel along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb in the brain.  The olfactory bulb processes these signals and forwards them to various brain regions, including the limbic system.  This connection explains why smells often evoke strong emotions and memories.  The sense of smell is unique in its direct link to the brain's emotional and memory centers.  Pheromones are chemical signals that influence social and reproductive behaviors in many species.  In humans, the role of pheromones is less pronounced but still under investigation.  Some studies suggest they may affect mood and interpersonal attraction.  The subtlety of pheromone influence in humans highlights the complexity of olfactory communication.  Odor memories can be remarkably vivid and long-lasting.  This phenomenon occurs because olfactory information is processed in the same brain areas responsible for memory and emotion.  Smells can trigger memories from decades past, underscoring the powerful connection between scent and personal history.  The interplay between olfaction and memory is a subject of ongoing research.  Three related subjects are the physiology of taste, the role of olfaction in animal behavior, and the impact of anosmia on daily life.",
