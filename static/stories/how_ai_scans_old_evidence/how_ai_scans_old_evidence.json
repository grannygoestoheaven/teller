  "clean_story": "Dusty files.  Hidden clues.\nAI scans old evidence like a detective with a magnifying glass—but faster, and without missing a speck. \"Scanning\" here means teaching machines to spot patterns humans overlook:fingerprints in faded ink, faces in blurry photos, or voices buried under static.\nTake handwritten letters. AI like Transkribus deciphers 19th-century cursive by comparing strokes to thousands of saved samples—like matching a key to a lock, but the lock learns new shapes. It flagged a forged signature in a 1920s contract by measuring ink pressure differences invisible to the eye.\nOr cold-case photos. Tools like NVIDIA’s Image Super-Resolution rebuild pixels from grainy shots, sharpening a 1978 license plate enough to trace a stolen car. They don’t guess—they fill gaps using math from astronomy, where telescopes do the same for distant stars.\nEven sound isn’t safe. Adobe’s Project VoCo isolated a muffled voice in a 1963 wiretap by filtering out hums—like tuning a radio to one station while silencing the rest. Courts now use it to verify confessions recorded on faulty equipment.\nThe limit?AI can’t invent what wasn’t there. But it reveals what time tried to erase.\nThree related subjects are forensic linguistics, digital artifact restoration, and how bias sneaks into algorithms.",
