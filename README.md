# teller (a_track_for_a_story)
### An AI storyteller that weaves a story, aiming to trigger deep focus.
### It reads and tells, quietly pacing with the flow of the music.

### The idea is to explore how sound alone can enhance focus by tweaking voice pace, tone, spatialization, and background music, among others.
### Each setting is inspired by cognitive science research, while the experience stays flexible and user-tuned.
