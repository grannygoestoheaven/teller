  "clean_story": "\"Filter bubbles. Polarization. Echo chambers combine these terms. Imagine a room where only one voice echoes, drowning out all others. This is what happens online when algorithms show us content similar to what we've engaged with before. They create a feedback loop, reinforcing our beliefs and shielding us from opposing views. \\n\\nIn 2016, researchers at MIT found that echo chambers on Twitter amplified political polarization. Users were exposed to fewer opposing viewpoints, making their beliefs more extreme. This isn't just about politics—it happens in health, science, and social issues too. A study in PLOS One showed how echo chambers on Facebook influenced vaccine hesitancy. \\n\\nEcho chambers aren't just about isolation—they also amplify misinformation. False news spreads faster than truth on social media. In echo chambers, misinformation can gain traction quickly, as users share it without fact-checking. A study in Science found that false news reached more people than the truth, especially among conservatives. \\n\\nBreaking out of echo chambers isn't easy. It requires conscious effort to seek diverse viewpoints and fact-check information. Social media platforms could help by showing users more diverse content, but this goes against their business model of maximizing engagement. Three related subjects are the role of algorithms in shaping our online experiences, the impact of echo chambers on democracy, and the potential for AI to help combat misinformation. \"\n\n(Char count: 849)",
