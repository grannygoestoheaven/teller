  "clean_story": "Planets orbiting stars. Exploring their mysteries. The word 'planetary science' combines 'planet' and 'science. ' It’s the study of planets, moons, and other objects in space, like how they form and what they’re made of. Planetary science is like being a space detective. Scientists use telescopes and spacecraft to gather clues about distant worlds. They study everything from the rocky surfaces of Mars to the stormy atmospheres of Jupiter. For example, NASA’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars, searching for signs of ancient life and collecting rock samples. These samples might one day reveal whether Mars ever had the conditions to support living organisms. One of the most fascinating discoveries in planetary science is the presence of water on other planets and moons. Water is essential for life as we know it, so finding it elsewhere in the solar system is a big deal. For instance, Jupiter’s moon Europa has a hidden ocean beneath its icy surface, and Saturn’s moon Enceladus spews water vapor into space. These findings suggest that life might exist in places we once thought were too harsh. Planetary science also helps us understand our own planet better. By studying other worlds, we can see how unique Earth is and what makes it suitable for life. For example, Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it incredibly hot and inhospitable. This helps scientists understand the delicate balance that keeps Earth’s climate stable. Three related subjects are the search for extraterrestrial life, the formation of solar systems, and the future of human space exploration.",
