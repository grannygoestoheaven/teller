  "clean": "Aggregate selection.  Temperature control.  Bitumen blending.  Precision in compaction.  The fabrication of asphalt begins with the careful selection of aggregates.  These aggregates, consisting of crushed stone, gravel, and sand, are chosen based on their size, shape, and durability.  Each component is meticulously measured to ensure the final mix meets specific structural and functional requirements.  The aggregates are then dried and heated to remove moisture, a step that is vital for the subsequent binding process.  Temperature control is paramount throughout the asphalt production process.  The aggregates are mixed with bitumen, a viscous liquid binder, at temperatures ranging from 140°C to 160°C.  This precise temperature range ensures optimal binding and workability of the asphalt mix.  Deviations can lead to inadequate bonding and reduced lifespan of the pavement.  Bitumen blending is conducted with precision, involving the integration of additives to enhance performance.  These additives may include polymers for increased elasticity or anti-stripping agents to improve moisture resistance.  The blend is continuously monitored to maintain uniformity and consistency throughout the batch.  This step is crucial for producing a durable and resilient asphalt surface.  Finally, precision in compaction is achieved through the use of specialized equipment.  Rollers apply controlled pressure to the hot asphalt, ensuring it is compacted to the desired density.  Proper compaction prevents air voids, which can lead to premature deterioration.  The result is a smooth, long-lasting pavement surface.
