  "clean": "Quantum entanglement.  Spooky action at a distance.  Non-locality.  Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where pairs or groups of particles interact in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others.  This means that a change in the state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  Albert Einstein famously referred to this as \"spooky action at a distance,\" highlighting the non-intuitive nature of the concept.  Experiments have repeatedly confirmed the existence of entanglement, challenging classical notions of locality and separability.  The implications of quantum entanglement are profound, particularly in the field of quantum computing and quantum cryptography.  In quantum computing, entangled states are used to perform computations that would be infeasible for classical computers.  Quantum cryptography leverages entanglement to create secure communication channels that are theoretically immune to eavesdropping.  These applications demonstrate the potential of entanglement to revolutionize technology.  Despite its proven existence, the mechanism behind quantum entanglement remains a subject of intense research and debate.  The phenomenon challenges the classical understanding of space and time, suggesting that our current models may be incomplete.  Theoretical physicists continue to explore the implications of entanglement, seeking a deeper understanding of the universe's fundamental principles.  This ongoing research could lead to new insights into the nature of reality itself.  Three related subjects are quantum teleportation, Bell's theorem, and the EPR paradox.",
