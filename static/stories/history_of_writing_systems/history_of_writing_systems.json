  "clean_story": "Marks on clay. Thoughts made permanent. The term \"writing\" comes from an Old English word, *writan*, meaning \"to score, draw, or inscribe\"—like carving letters into wood or pressing shapes into wet clay. Writing didn’t start as letters or words. Around **3400 BCE**, Mesopotamian accountants used small clay tokens to track goods like sheep or grain. Each token shape—a cone for a measure of barley, a disk for a sheep—stood for a specific item. To keep records straight, they pressed these tokens into clay balls, creating the first \"receipts. \" Later, they skipped the tokens and drew the shapes directly into clay with a reed stylus. These marks evolved into **cuneiform**, the first true writing system—wedge-shaped symbols representing sounds, words, and numbers. Meanwhile, in **3200 BCE Egypt**, scribes developed **hieroglyphs**—pictures that could stand for objects (a sun), sounds (the \"ra\" in \"Ramesses\"), or ideas (eternity). Unlike cuneiform’s abstract wedges, hieroglyphs stayed close to their real-world forms: an owl for the \"m\" sound, a reed for \"y. \" They were carved into stone or painted on papyrus, a plant-based paper so durable some scrolls survive today. Writing spread by solving problems. Chinese characters emerged around **1200 BCE** as divination marks on animal bones, later becoming **logograms**—symbols for whole words. The Phoenicians, traders in **1050 BCE Lebanon**, simplified writing further by creating the first **alphabet**: 22 symbols for consonants (vowels came later). Their system was easy to learn, so it spread fast—Greeks added vowels, Romans refined the shapes, and now you’re reading this. Each system had trade-offs. Cuneiform needed 600+ symbols; hieroglyphs, thousands. Alphabets required fewer marks but lost the visual meaning of logograms. Materials mattered too: clay tablets survived fires, papyrus rotted in humidity, and parchment (animal skin) lasted centuries but cost a fortune. The **printing press (1440 CE)** changed everything—Johannes Gutenberg’s movable type turned hand-copied books into mass-produced texts, dropping the price of a Bible from **three years’ wages to three months’**. Today, writing lives in pixels and emojis, but the core idea remains: turning fleeting thoughts into something that outlasts us. The shift from tokens to tablets, from scrolls to screens. How a reed stylus led to keyboards. The quiet revolution of symbols that built civilizations.",
