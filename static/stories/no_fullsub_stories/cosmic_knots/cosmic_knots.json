Etymology: The term \"cosmic knots\" originates from the concept of \"knots\" in topology, a branch of mathematics that studies properties preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects.<[silence]>\n\n3. Spark Event: The defining moment for cosmic knots came when physicists realized that cosmic strings, predicted by certain grand unified theories, could form stable knots. This realization was sparked by the discovery of topological defects in condensed matter systems, which provided a tangible analogy for understanding cosmic phenomena.<[silence]>\n\n4. Mechanism: Cosmic knots form when cosmic strings loop and intertwine, creating stable configurations due to their immense tension and energy. These knots are hypothesized to be incredibly dense, with a mass per unit length so high that they could warp spacetime around them. For example, a cosmic knot the size of a proton could weigh as much as a mountain, exerting gravitational effects that could influence the motion of nearby galaxies.<[silence]>\n\n5. Impact: One measurable outcome of cosmic knots could be their gravitational lensing effects, where the intense gravitational field of a knot bends light from distant stars and galaxies, creating multiple images or arcs.
