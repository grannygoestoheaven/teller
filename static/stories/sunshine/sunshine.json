  "clean_story": "Warmth from above. Light that feeds life. \"Sunshine\" is just the sun’s energy reaching Earth—visible light, heat, and invisible rays like ultraviolet. It travels 93 million miles in 8 minutes, moving faster than anything else in the universe. Most see it as golden brightness, but its real work happens unseen. Plants use it like a recipe book—sunlight splits water molecules, mixes them with carbon dioxide, and builds sugar for growth. Without this, no wheat fields, no forests, no oxygen. Human skin turns sunlight into vitamin D—a chemical factory triggered by UV rays. Just 10 minutes of midday sun can produce a day’s supply. Too much, though, and those same rays damage DNA, forcing cells to repair or rebel. Sunshine also shapes weather. When it hits land faster than water, breezes form—like a giant lung inhaling over oceans, exhaling over deserts. Solar panels now trap its energy, converting photons into electricity at 20% efficiency. Three related subjects are photosynthesis mechanics, UV radiation effects, and how cultures worshipped the sun.",
