  "clean_story": "\"Greatest good. Happiness for all. Utilitarianism comes from the word 'utility,' meaning usefulness or benefit. It’s a way of thinking about right and wrong by focusing on actions that bring the most happiness to the most people. \\n\\nImagine you have a big cake to share with friends. Instead of giving it all to one person, you slice it so everyone gets a piece, making the whole group happy. That’s utilitarianism in action—choosing what spreads joy the furthest. This idea was popularized by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, who believed that the best actions are those that increase overall happiness. \\n\\nIn real life, utilitarianism can guide decisions like building a park instead of a parking lot, because more people might enjoy the park. Or, it might mean choosing to help someone in need, because their happiness adds to the total happiness of everyone. \\n\\nHowever, it’s not always simple. Sometimes, what makes many people happy might hurt a few, so it’s important to think carefully about the consequences. It’s like balancing a seesaw, trying to keep both sides even. \\n\\nThree related subjects are ethics in decision-making, the balance between individual and group needs, and how happiness is measured in society. \"",
