  "clean_story": "**Testing ideas. Finding truth.**\n\nThe term *scientific method* describes a step-by-step process to answer questions by gathering evidence—like a detective solving a mystery, but with experiments instead of guesses.\n\nMost people think science is about lab coats and explosions, but its real power lies in **doubt**. A scientist starts with a question (*\"Why do plants grow taller in sunlight?\"*), then makes a guess (*\"Maybe sunlight gives them energy.\"*). Instead of stopping there, they test it: grow two identical plants, give one sunlight, shade the other, and measure the difference. If the sunny plant grows taller, the guess holds—*for now*. If not, the guess was wrong, and the search continues. This cycle—**observe, question, predict, test, refine**—is how we separate facts from assumptions.\n\nCritical thinking is the method’s sharpest tool. It means **asking hard questions**: *\"How do we know this is true?\" \"What if we’re missing something?\"* A 19th-century doctor, Ignaz Semmelweis, noticed women in hospitals died more often when treated by doctors fresh from autopsies. Instead of accepting \"that’s just how it is,\" he tested handwashing with chlorine—deaths dropped by 90%. His peers rejected the idea for years, proving even good evidence can lose to habit. Critical thinking demands we **challenge our own beliefs**, not just others’.\n\nThe method isn’t just for scientists. A chef testing recipe tweaks, a mechanic diagnosing a car’s rattle follows the same steps: **change one thing, watch what happens, adjust**. Its strength is in **repeatability**—if an experiment works in Tokyo, it should work in Buenos Aires. No magic, no authority, just proof.\n\nWhat breaks when we skip steps? How do biases sneak into \"obvious\" truths? And why do some discoveries take decades to accept?",
