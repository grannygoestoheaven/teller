  "clean_story": "\"Cosmic exploration. Unraveling mysteries. Astrophysics combines 'astro'—from the Greek 'astron,' meaning star—and 'physics,' the study of nature's laws. It's like using a telescope to peer into the universe's rulebook. Most people think astrophysics is all about gazing at stars, but its true power lies in the tools it uses to unravel the cosmos. Take the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, for instance. Discovered in 1964, it's the oldest light in the universe, released just 380,000 years after the Big Bang. By studying its tiny fluctuations, astrophysicists can map the universe's earliest moments, like reading a baby's first words to understand its language. Another tool is gravitational lensing. Massive objects like black holes warp space-time, bending light and creating a 'lens' effect. This lets us see distant galaxies and even detect dark matter, which doesn't emit light but warps space. Astrophysics isn't just about looking back in time; it also helps us understand our place in the universe. By studying exoplanets, we're finding worlds that could harbor life. And by understanding stellar evolution, we're learning about our own Sun's future. Three related subjects are how astrophysics is reshaping our understanding of time, the search for habitable exoplanets, and the quest to find the universe's first stars.",
