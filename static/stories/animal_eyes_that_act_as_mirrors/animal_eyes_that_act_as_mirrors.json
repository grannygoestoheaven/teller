  "clean_story": "Eyes like flashlights.  Night vision without batteries. \"Mirror eyes\" describe how some animals use reflective layers—not lenses—to bounce light, turning dim glows into clear signals. Most eyes work like cameras:Light enters the lens, hits the back, and paints a picture. But in deep water or moonlight, that’s not enough. Enter the tapetum lucidum—a mirror behind the retina. It’s like shining a flashlight into a hallway, then placing a mirror at the end to double the brightness. Here’s the trick:Photons (light particles) pass through the retina once—then the tapetum bounces them back for a second try. This recycles every scrap of light, boosting sensitivity 6x. Deer see a wolf’s silhouette in starlight. Deep-sea fish spot prey by the glow of bioluminescent algae. Even your dog’s \"glowing\" eyes in photos?That’s the tapetum reflecting your camera’s flash. The trade-off?Sharpness blurs—like over-exposing a photo. But for survival, clarity matters less than seeing anything at all. Three related subjects are bioluminescent communication, how squid change eye shape, and human night-blindness fixes.",
