  "clean_story": "\"Tornadoes. Nature's most powerful winds. A dance of air and weather. The term 'tornado' comes from Spanish 'tronada,' meaning thunderstorm. It's fitting, as tornadoes are born from the chaos of severe thunderstorms. Most people know tornadoes form over flat lands, but the precise process is less understood. \\n\\nImagine a warm, humid day. The sun heats the ground, creating a hot, rising air bubble—the initial 'lift. ' This warm air meets cooler air above, creating instability. Like a seesaw, the warm air rises faster, drawing in more air to replace it, creating an invisible, spinning tube. This is the beginning of a mesocyclone, the tornado's parent storm. As the spin intensifies, it starts to stretch downward, like a finger poking into the ground. This is the tornado's funnel, visible only when it touches the surface. The funnel's strength depends on how fast the air spins and how much it stretches—the faster and longer, the stronger the tornado. \\n\\nTornadoes aren't just about speed—they're also about precision. The Fujita scale rates them based on wind speed and damage, but it's the funnel's tight, spinning core that makes them so destructive. This core can be as narrow as a few feet, yet pack winds over 200 mph. It's like a tiny, invisible drill boring into the earth. Three related subjects are the role of wind shear in tornado formation, the unique microbursts that sometimes trigger tornadoes, and the fascinating world of tornado chasers who study these storms up close. \"\n\n(Character count: 849)",
