  "clean_story": "Digital ledgers. Trust without middlemen. The term *blockchain* combines *block*—a bundle of data—and *chain*—the unbreakable link between them. It’s like a notebook where each page is glued to the next, and every entry is checked by everyone holding a copy. Most people think of blockchain as the tech behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But its real power is simpler: it lets strangers agree on facts without relying on banks, governments, or corporations. Here’s how it works. Imagine a classroom where every student has a identical notebook. When Lisa lends Mark $5, she writes it down, and everyone copies the note into their own notebook. Later, if Mark claims he only borrowed $3, the class checks their notebooks and sees the truth. No teacher needed. Blockchain does this digitally, using math instead of trust. Each \"block\" holds a list of transactions (like Lisa’s loan) and a unique code called a *hash*—a digital fingerprint. The next block includes the previous block’s hash, linking them like paper clips. If someone tries to alter an old transaction, the hash changes, breaking the chain. Computers worldwide—called *nodes*—spot the mismatch and reject the fake. This system isn’t just for money. In Estonia, blockchain secures medical records so patients control who sees their data. Walmart uses it to track mangoes from farm to shelf in seconds, not days. Artists sell *NFTs*—unique digital tokens—proving ownership without galleries. The trade-off? Speed and energy. Bitcoin’s blockchain processes 7 transactions per second; Visa handles 24,000. And \"mining\"—the math work to add blocks—uses more electricity than Sweden. Newer blockchains like Solana or Algorand cut costs by changing how nodes agree, but no system is perfect. What happens when databases can’t be faked? How do you prove *you’re you* in a world without passwords? And if code replaces contracts, who’s responsible when it fails?",
