  "clean_story": "Survival through play.  Training disguised as games.\n\"Play-as-survival-training\" means learning critical skills—like fire-making or shelter-building—through structured, engaging challenges instead of rigid drills. Most survival courses rely on repetition and stress tests. This method turns those lessons into scenarios with rules, rewards, and consequences—like a game. Imagine teaching navigation by hiding supplies in a forest and scoring players on speed and stealth. The mechanics borrow from three systems:Military \"crawl-walk-run\" (master basics before complexity), scouting games (team-based problem-solving), and escape rooms (time pressure + puzzles). Example:A 2019 Norwegian study had participants \"earn\" matches by solving riddles tied to hypothermia symptoms. Retention rates for fire-starting jumped 40% compared to traditional lectures. Key difference?Failure isn’t punished—it’s a puzzle reset. A broken shelter becomes a chance to test knot-tying under \"rain\" (sprinklers). Tools like adventure labs (GPS-based challenges) or survival card decks (randomized disaster scenarios) keep sessions unpredictable. Three related subjects are gamified first aid drills, wilderness psychology tricks, and how kids learn risk assessment.",
