  "clean_story": "Natural healing. Beyond conventional drugs. The term *alternative medicine* refers to treatments used **instead of** standard medical care, like herbs, acupuncture, or meditation. It’s called \"alternative\" because it offers a different path when traditional methods fall short or aren’t preferred. Many turn to these practices for chronic pain, stress, or illnesses where modern medicine lacks clear answers. For example, ginger tea soothes nausea like a drug might, but without synthetic chemicals. Acupuncture, using thin needles on specific body points, is believed to restore energy flow—like rebooting a stuck computer. Studies show it can ease back pain better than placebos in some cases. Yet not all alternatives are equal. Some, like yoga for anxiety, have strong scientific backing. Others, like crystal healing, rely on belief more than evidence. The challenge? Separating proven methods from untested claims. Cultures have used these practices for centuries—Ayurveda in India, traditional Chinese medicine, or Native American herbal remedies. Today, they’re often blended with modern care, like using meditation alongside therapy for depression. But caution is key. Delaying proven treatments (like chemotherapy) for untested alternatives can be risky. The best approach? Research, consult experts, and weigh options carefully. This leads to bigger questions: How do we measure healing beyond lab results? Can ancient wisdom and modern science coexist? What does \"evidence\" even mean when bodies and minds respond differently?",
