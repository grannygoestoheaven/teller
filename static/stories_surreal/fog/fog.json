  "tagged_story_for_tts": "Fog is the breath of the earth—slow, deliberate, a ghostly exhalation that blurs the edges of reality. It drifts like a thief, stealing landmarks and muffling sound until the world feels both vast and claustrophobic. Trees dissolve into smudges of charcoal; streetlamps glow like suspended moons in a sea of gray. Time softens here—seconds stretch, memories flicker at the periphery of vision, half-formed.\n\nIt is neither liquid nor air but a liminal haze where past and present collide: the sigh of a ship’s horn lost a century ago, the damp press of a stranger’s coat in a crowd you can’t see. Fog does not announce itself; it simply is, a silent conspiracy between moisture and stillness, erasing borders until all that remains is the quiet hum of your own pulse, wondering if the next step will meet ground—or nothing at all.",
