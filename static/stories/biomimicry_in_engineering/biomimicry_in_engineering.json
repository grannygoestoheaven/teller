  "clean_story": "\"Nature’s blueprints. Engineering copies them. \"\n\nBiomimicry means stealing smart ideas from plants, animals, and microbes—then using them to solve human problems.\n\nEngineers once designed by trial and error. Now they ask: \"How would nature do this?\"\n\nA shark’s skin isn’t smooth—it’s covered in tiny, tooth-like scales called denticles. These reduce drag so well that Speedo copied the pattern for swimsuits in 2008. At the Beijing Olympics, 98% of medalists wore them. Banned later for being too effective.\n\nJapan’s Shinkansen bullet train had a noise problem at 200 mph. Engineers studied the kingfisher’s beak—shaped to slice water silently. Redesigning the train’s nose cut noise by 30% and used 15% less energy.\n\nTermite mounds stay cool in 100°F heat by circulating air through tunnels. Architects used the same trick in Zimbabwe’s Eastgate Centre. No AC needed—it uses 90% less energy than similar buildings.\n\nThree related subjects are velcro’s burdock inspiration, whale-fin wind turbines, and ant-colony traffic algorithms.",
