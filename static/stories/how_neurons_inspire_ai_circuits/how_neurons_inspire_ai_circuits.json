  "clean_story": "Brain’s wiring blueprint.  AI’s borrowed spark. \"Neuron\" comes from Greek neuron—meaning \"sinew\" or \"cord,\" like the body’s electrical threads. A neuron doesn’t \"think\"—it fires. When voltage hits a threshold, it sends a spike down its axon, like a domino knocking over the next. No clock ticks inside it. No central boss. Just 86 billion of these cells, each connecting to thousands of others, passing signals in chains. AI stole two tricks:First, the perceptron—a 1957 math copy of a neuron. —Take inputs, weigh them, fire if the sum crosses a line. Early versions failed at XOR (a basic logic gate), proving one fake neuron wasn’t enough. Second, backpropagation—the brain’s rough equivalent of adjusting synapse strength after mistakes. In AI, it’s an algorithm tweaking weights to shrink errors, like a gardener pruning branches for better fruit. Example:Your phone’s voice assistant hears \"cat\" because layers of artificial neurons—each specializing in edges, textures, or sounds—vote until the network agrees. No single neuron \"knows\" what a cat is. The pattern emerges from the crowd. Difference?A biological neuron runs on ~100 millivolts and chemicals. —An AI \"neuron\" is a float in code, burning watts. One learns from a lifetime of smells, touches, and stumbles. —The other trains on labeled datasets in hours. Three related subjects are spiking neural networks, how synapses prune unused paths, and energy costs of brains vs chips.",
