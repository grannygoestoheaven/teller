  "clean_story": "\"Equations. Problem-solving. The word 'algebra' comes from the Arabic word 'al-jabr,' which means 'reunion of broken parts. ' It’s like putting together pieces to solve a puzzle. \\nAlgebra is often seen as a set of rules for solving math problems, but it’s really a way to describe patterns and relationships. Think of it like a recipe: you know the steps, but you can use different ingredients to get the same result. \\nFor example, if you have an equation like 2x + 3 = 7, you’re trying to find the value of 'x' that makes the equation true. It’s like having a balance scale: you adjust the weights until both sides are equal. \\nAlgebra isn’t just about numbers, though. It can also describe real-world situations, like calculating how much paint you need for a wall or figuring out the best route for a delivery truck. \\nThree related subjects are geometry, the history of math, and how algorithms shape modern technology. \"",
