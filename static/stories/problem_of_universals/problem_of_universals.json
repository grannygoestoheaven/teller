  "clean_story": "**Universals. Shared ideas. ** The term 'universals' refers to concepts that apply across different things, like the idea of 'redness' that applies to apples and roses. The problem of universals asks: Do these shared ideas exist on their own, or are they just names we use? Imagine you have three red objects—a fire truck, a rose, and a stop sign. What makes them all 'red'? Is there something called 'redness' that exists separately from these objects, or is 'red' just a word we use for similar colors? This debate goes back centuries. Some philosophers, like Plato, believed universals exist in a perfect world of ideas. Others, like Aristotle, argued that universals are just tools we use to group things together. For example, when we say 'dog,' we’re grouping many different animals under one idea. But does 'dogness' exist on its own, or is it just a way to describe certain traits? The problem of universals isn’t just about words—it’s about how we understand the world. If universals exist independently, then our knowledge of them might be limited. But if they’re just labels, then our understanding is shaped by language and culture. This affects everything from science to philosophy, as it influences how we categorize and study the world around us. For example, in biology, scientists use universals like 'species' to group organisms. But what makes a species a species? Is it a real division in nature, or just a useful way to organize living things? The answer could change how we study evolution and genetics. The problem of universals also touches on math and logic. Numbers and shapes seem universal, but do they exist outside our minds? Or are they just tools we’ve created to make sense of the world? These questions challenge how we think about truth and reality. Ultimately, the problem of universals reminds us that even simple ideas can lead to deep questions. It shows how language, thought, and reality are connected, and how our understanding of the world depends on the frameworks we use. Related subjects: **ontology, epistemology, and semantics. **.",
