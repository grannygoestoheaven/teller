# This runs as root, ensuring it has the power to change anything.
# chown -R appuser:appuser /app: Recursively changes owner and group to appuser.

#   u=rwX: user (appuser) has read, write, execute (X for directories)
#   g=rX: group (appuser) has read, execute (X for directories)
#   o=rX: others have read, execute (X for directories)
