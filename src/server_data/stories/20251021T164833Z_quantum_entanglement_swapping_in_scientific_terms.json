  "clean": "Quantum entanglement swapping. Non-local correlations. Quantum teleportation. Entanglement swapping is a quantum phenomenon where two particles, previously unentangled, become entangled through the interaction of a third pair of entangled particles. This process involves two pairs of particles, say A-B and C-D, where A and B, as well as C and D, are initially entangled. By performing a joint Bell-state measurement on particles B and C, the entanglement is effectively \"swapped\" to particles A and D, even though they have never interacted directly. The significance of entanglement swapping lies in its ability to extend quantum entanglement over larger distances, a foundational principle for quantum communication networks. It enables the creation of entangled states between distant particles, facilitating the development of quantum repeaters, which are essential for long-distance quantum communication. This technique also plays a pivotal role in quantum teleportation, where the state of a quantum system is transferred from one location to another without physical transmission of the system itself. The experimental realization of entanglement swapping requires precise control over quantum systems and accurate measurement techniques. Advances in photonic technology and quantum optics have enabled the successful demonstration of this phenomenon in laboratory settings, paving the way for practical applications. The ability to manipulate entanglement in this manner is a testament to the non-classical nature of quantum mechanics and its potential to revolutionize information processing. Three related subjects are quantum cryptography, quantum repeaters, and quantum key distribution.",
