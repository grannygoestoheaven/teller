  "clean_story": "\"Spotting lies. Trusting facts. The word 'misinformation' means false or misleading information shared without harmful intent, while 'disinformation' is false info spread deliberately to deceive. Propaganda is a form of disinformation used to promote a political agenda. Fake news is a broader term for fabricated stories that mimic real news to mislead. To spot misinformation, start by checking the source. Is it a well-known, reputable news outlet, or is it a website you’ve never heard of? Look for signs like poor grammar, sensational headlines, or lack of author credentials. A quick search can reveal if the story has been debunked by fact-checking sites like Snopes or FactCheck. org. Propaganda often uses emotional language to sway opinions. It might present only one side of an issue, using loaded words or images to create a biased view. For example, a political ad might show only negative images of an opponent while ignoring their achievements. Recognizing these tactics helps you see through the manipulation. Fake news often spreads quickly on social media, where algorithms favor engagement over accuracy. If a story seems too shocking to be true, it probably is. Cross-checking with multiple sources can help confirm whether the information is reliable. Tools like Google Reverse Image Search can also help verify if images or videos have been altered or taken out of context. Three related subjects are how social media algorithms influence what we see, the psychology behind why people believe false information, and the role of fact-checkers in maintaining trust in journalism. \"",
