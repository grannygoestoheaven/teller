  "clean_story": "\"Unpredictable systems. Tiny shifts, huge effects. \"\nThe word chaos comes from Greek khaos, meaning \"void\" or \"gap\"—a space where order hasn’t taken hold.\n\nChaos isn’t just mess. It’s a system so sensitive that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could trigger a tornado in Texas. Scientists call this the butterfly effect—small changes snowballing into massive, unpredictable outcomes.\n\nTake weather: a 1°C temperature shift might seem trivial, but it can reroute storms. Or stock markets: a single tweet can crash values in minutes. Chaos thrives where tiny inputs spiral—like a row of dominoes, but with no way to guess which will fall first.\n\nYet chaos isn’t random. Hidden patterns exist, like the Lorenz attractor, a math shape showing how chaos loops without repeating. Nature uses it: your heartbeat’s \"chaotic\" rhythm adapts faster than a steady one.\n\nThree related subjects are fractal geometry, quantum uncertainty and emergent behavior.",
