  "clean_story": "Earth’s early warning system.  Animals sense tremors before humans. \"Seismic sensing\" describes how creatures detect vibrations—tiny ripples in soil, water, or air—often minutes or hours before earthquakes strike. Dogs bark frantically.  Elephants flee inland.  Toads abandon ponds. These aren’t coincidences—it’s physics. Before a quake, rocks deep underground crack, releasing low-frequency waves called P-waves—too faint for us, but not for them. Snakes press their jaws to the ground, feeling vibrations through bone conduction, like a stethoscope for the earth. Elephants’ feet have pressure-sensitive pads that act as seismic antennas, picking up rumbles 10+ miles away. In 2004, researchers in Thailand noted elephants breaking chains and running to higher ground hours before the Indian Ocean tsunami. Their infrasound detection—sounds below 20 Hz—may have warned them. Even ants change behavior: colonies reduce foraging 24 hours pre-quake, likely sensing gas leaks or electrostatic shifts. Humans try to replicate this. China’s Yunnan Earthquake Prediction Office trained dogs to signal alarms in the 1970s. Japan monitors catfish activity—historically, their erratic swimming preceded tremors. Three related subjects are bio-inspired earthquake detectors, animal infrasound communication, and how volcanoes trigger mass exoduses.",
