  "clean_story": "\"Mutual agreement. Collective governance. The term 'social contract' combines 'social,' meaning people together, and 'contract,' an agreement. It's a philosophical concept that society is formed by individuals consenting to rules that protect their rights and maintain order. Imagine a group of people agreeing to create a traffic system to keep everyone safe and moving. They give up some freedoms, like driving however they want, but gain the benefits of order and safety. This is the essence of social contract theory. It's been around since ancient times, with philosophers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau contributing key ideas. Hobbes famously argued that without such a contract, life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. ' Locke, however, believed people would naturally agree to protect their 'life, liberty, and estate. ' Today, it's seen in our laws, constitutions, and everyday norms. Yet, it's not without debate. Some argue it's a fiction, as people never explicitly agreed to these rules. Others question if it's truly voluntary, given the power dynamics in society. Three related subjects are the evolution of social contract theory, its practical applications in modern society, and the ongoing debates about its validity and limitations.",
