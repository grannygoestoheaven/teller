  "clean_story": "\"Digital protection. Safeguarding data. The term 'cybersecurity' combines 'cyber,' meaning computer systems, and 'security,' which means protection. Together, they describe the tools and practices that keep digital information safe from threats. Imagine your personal data as a locked treasure chest. Cybersecurity is like the lock and key that keeps it safe from thieves. Without it, anyone could access your passwords, bank details, or private messages. Cybersecurity ensures that only the right people can open the chest. One of the biggest threats to cybersecurity is phishing. This is when hackers trick you into giving them your information, like a fake email pretending to be from your bank. Another common threat is malware, which is like a digital virus that can damage your computer or steal your data. Cybersecurity tools, like firewalls and antivirus software, act as shields against these attacks. Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology. It also involves good habits, like using strong passwords and being cautious about what you click online. For example, if an email looks suspicious, it’s better to delete it than risk falling for a scam. Companies also use encryption, which is like scrambling your data so that even if someone steals it, they can’t read it. Three related subjects are the history of hacking, how artificial intelligence is changing cybersecurity, and the importance of protecting personal privacy online. \"",
