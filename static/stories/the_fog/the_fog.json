  "tagged_story_for_tts": "The fog is a breath held between worlds—a slow, creeping hymn of dissolution. It swallows edges first: the jagged teeth of rooftops, the skeletal fingers of winter branches, the whispered boundaries where earth meets sky. Light does not pierce it; it bleeds into the haze, diffused into a sickly glow, like memory half-remembered through gauze.\n\nIt moves without sound, yet hums in the bones—a static chorus of damp and decay. Footsteps vanish mid-stride. Voices return as their own ghosts, muffled and wrong. The fog does not obscure; it unmakes, reducing the known to silhouette and suggestion. A streetlamp becomes a smudge of gold. A stranger’s face, a shifting Rorschach of possibility.\n\nTime here is not linear but viscous. Minutes stretch like taffy. The past leaks in—fragments of laughter from a childhood porch, the phantom scent of woodsmoke from a fire long cold. The fog does not judge your hesitation. It absorbs it, thickens with it, until you forget which way you were heading—or if you were ever moving at all.\n\nTo walk in it is to be both witness and wisp: half-solid, half-story. The world narrows to the radius of your breath, each exhale a fleeting claim against erasure. And when it lifts—if it lifts—you’re left wondering: was that shape in the mist ever there? Or was it only the fog, holding up a mirror?",
