  "clean_story": "Words as brain maps.  Sounds turned into meaning. \"How brains store words\" describes the process where spoken or written language transforms into neural patterns—like saving a song’s melody by humming it until your mind remembers the notes. Most assume words live in one \"language center,\" like a mental dictionary. Instead, they’re scattered across networks, linked by sound, meaning, and memory. Here’s the mechanism:When you hear \"apple,\" your auditory cortex breaks the word into sounds—/æ/, /p/, /l/. These sounds trigger neurons in Wernicke’s area, which pull up the concept: round, red, sweet. Simultaneously, Broca’s area prepares your mouth to say it back. But storage isn’t just about sound. The word \"run\" lights up motor areas if you’ve sprinted before—your brain ties the word to the feeling of legs moving. \"Bank\" sparks different neurons for a financier (money) versus an angler (river edge). Damage proves this fragmentation:A stroke in Wernicke’s area leaves a person hearing words as noise. Damage to the angular gyrus erases reading ability—letters become squiggles. Yet the brain adapts. Deaf signers’ \"word storage\" relies on visual and motor pathways, not sound. Bilinguals switch between languages by suppressing one network while activating another. Three related subjects are neural plasticity shifts, how children acquire language, and why some words feel ‘sticky’ in memory.",
