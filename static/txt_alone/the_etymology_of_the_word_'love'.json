The word \"love\" finds its roots in the Old English term \"lufu,\" which is derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"lubō. \"  This Proto-Germanic origin is linked to the Proto-Indo-European root \"*leubh-,\" which conveys the idea of care or desire.  The Old English \"lufu\" was used to describe affection, friendliness, and romantic attachment.  Over time, the term evolved to encompass a broader range of emotions and relationships.  As the English language developed, the influence of Latin became more pronounced.
