  "clean_story": "Cold morning launch.  Seventy-three seconds to tragedy. \"Challenger\" was the name of NASA’s space shuttle—part rocket, part airplane—that carried astronauts into orbit like a school bus to the stars. On January 28, 1986, it lifted off in Florida’s freezing temperatures,  something its rubber O-rings—the flexible seals between rocket sections—weren’t built to handle. Engineers warned the cold could make them stiff and brittle,  like a rubber band left in the freezer. At liftoff, flames shot past the failed seal,  burning through fuel and metal until the shuttle broke apart mid-air. The crew cabin survived the explosion but fell for nearly three minutes before hitting the ocean. None of the seven astronauts—including teacher Christa McAuliffe—survived. Investigations later revealed a culture of rushed decisions at NASA,  where safety concerns were ignored to meet launch deadlines. Physicist Richard Feynman famously dropped an O-ring into ice water during hearings,  proving it lost flexibility—just as engineers had feared. Three related subjects are shuttle program redesigns, engineering ethics failures, and how cold affects materials.",
