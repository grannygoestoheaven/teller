  "clean_story": "Evidence. Proof over belief. Evidence is information that supports a claim, like receipts proving a purchase. It’s the difference between saying \"I think it rained\" and showing a weather report. Evidence helps us tell facts from opinions and stories. Facts are things that can be proven, like \"The Earth orbits the Sun. \" Opinions are personal beliefs, like \"Sunsets are beautiful. \" Anecdotes are personal stories, like \"I once saw a sunset that made me cry. \" Evidence helps us decide which claims to trust. For example, if someone says \"Eating carrots improves vision,\" evidence like scientific studies can show if it’s true or just a myth. Without evidence, we might believe anything. Three related subjects are how science uses evidence to discover truths, the role of bias in shaping opinions, and why personal stories aren’t always reliable proof.",
