Cognitive processes.\n\n The déjà-vu effect is a phenomenon where an individual experiences a sensation of having already lived through the present situation.  This experience is often fleeting and accompanied by a sense of familiarity.  Neurologically, déjà-vu is linked to the temporal lobe of the brain, where memory and recognition processes occur.  Studies suggest that déjà-vu may arise from a misalignment in the brain's memory systems, causing a current experience to be incorrectly flagged as a past memory.   Research indicates that déjà-vu is more common in younger individuals and tends to decrease with age.  It is often triggered by stress or fatigue, which can affect cognitive functions.  While déjà-vu is generally harmless, it can be more frequent in individuals with certain neurological conditions, such as epilepsy.  This has led researchers to explore the connections between déjà-vu and neural activity, particularly in the temporal lobe.   Psychological theories propose that déjà-vu may be a result of dual processing, where the brain simultaneously processes information through both conscious and subconscious pathways.
