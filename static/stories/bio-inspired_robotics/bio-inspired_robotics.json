  "clean_story": "Machines mimicking life.  Nature’s blueprints for robots. \"Bio-inspired robotics\" means designing robots by copying how animals, insects, or even plants solve problems—because evolution already tested these solutions for millions of years. A gecko’s foot isn’t sticky—it’s covered in tiny hairs that grip surfaces using molecular forces. Robots now use the same trick to climb glass walls without glue. StickyBot, built at Stanford, scales smooth surfaces by pressing and peeling its silicone \"toes,\" just like a gecko. Cockroaches flatten their bodies to squeeze under cracks in 0. 4 seconds. UC Berkeley’s CRAM robot does the same—its shell collapses like an accordion, letting it dart through rubble after earthquakes. Speed matters: CRAM moves 20 body lengths per second, twice as fast as a cheetah relative to size. Octopuses have no bones, so they squeeze through holes smaller than their eyes. Harvard’s soft robot mimics this—its silicone body inflates and deflates like a balloon animal, wriggling under doors. No gears, no joints—just air and flexible skin. Even plants inspire. Vines grow toward light by elongating cells on one side. MIT’s \"growbot\" does this with a 3D-printed tip that oozes resin, hardening into a stem—building its own structure as it climbs. Why copy life?Evolution optimized these designs for energy, adaptability, and resilience. A cheetah’s spine bends like a spring, storing and releasing energy with each stride. MIT’s Cheetah robot replicates this, running 13 mph while using half the power of rigid-legged bots. Three related subjects are swarm robot coordination, self-healing synthetic materials, and how neurons inspire AI circuits.",
