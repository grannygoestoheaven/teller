  "clean_story": "**Constructing arguments. Persuading minds. **\nThe word 'debate' comes from Latin *debatere*, meaning 'to strike down. ' It’s about dismantling ideas to build stronger ones. Debate isn’t just about winning—it’s about crafting clear, logical arguments that persuade others. Think of it like building a bridge: you need solid foundations (facts), strong beams (logic), and a clear path (structure) to get your point across. To construct a persuasive argument, start with a claim—your main point. Then, support it with evidence, like statistics or expert opinions. Finally, use reasoning to connect the dots, showing why your evidence backs up your claim. For example, if you argue that schools should have longer recess, you might cite studies showing how breaks improve focus, then explain how this leads to better grades. Deconstructing arguments is just as important. It means breaking down someone else’s argument to see if it holds up. Ask: Is the evidence reliable? Does the reasoning make sense? If not, you can point out the flaws, like finding weak spots in a bridge. Three related subjects are the psychology of persuasion, the role of logic in decision-making, and how rhetoric shapes public opinion.",
