  "clean_story": "\"What if?\" questions.  Rewriting past choices.\nThe term counterfactual thinking comes from \"counter\" (against) and \"factual\" (what actually happened). It’s like mentally pressing rewind on a movie—then editing one detail to see how the story changes.\nMost people use it without realizing. Missed your bus? Your brain might flash: \"If I’d left five minutes earlier, I’d be on time. \" That’s counterfactual thinking—simulating alternate realities to learn, regret, or plan.\nTwo types exist:\nUpward counterfactuals twist reality for the better (\"If I’d studied, I’d have passed\").\nDownward counterfactuals do the opposite (\"At least I didn’t fail worse\").\nBoth serve a purpose. Upward fuels motivation. Downward eases disappointment.\nExample: After a car accident, drivers replay \"If I’d braked sooner…\" to avoid future mistakes. Athletes use it too—reviewing games to imagine better plays.\nThe brain treats these \"what-ifs\" almost like real memories. fMRI scans show the same neural networks lighting up for actual events and imagined alternatives. This blurring helps us extract lessons without repeating failures.\nBut there’s a cost. Overuse breeds regret. Studies link excessive counterfactuals to lower life satisfaction—like scratching a mental scab.\nThree related subjects are cognitive dissonance reduction, the hindsight bias effect, and how AI simulates alternatives.",
