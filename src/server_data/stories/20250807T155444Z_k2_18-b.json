  "clean": "Hydrogen-rich atmosphere.  Potential for liquid water.  Exoplanetary discovery.  K2-18b is an exoplanet located 124 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Leo.  It orbits the red dwarf star K2-18 and was discovered in 2015 by the Kepler Space Telescope.  This planet has garnered significant attention due to its position within the habitable zone of its star, where conditions might allow for the presence of liquid water.  The planet is classified as a super-Earth, with a size approximately 2. 6 times that of Earth and a mass about 8. 6 times greater.  Observations have revealed that K2-18b possesses a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which is a point of interest for researchers studying atmospheric composition and potential habitability.  The presence of water vapor in its atmosphere was confirmed in 2019, marking it as a candidate for further study in the search for life beyond our solar system.  K2-18b's unique characteristics make it a prime target for future observations with advanced telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope.  Scientists aim to gather more detailed data on its atmospheric conditions and surface characteristics.  These observations could provide insights into the planet's potential to support life, as well as enhance our understanding of exoplanetary systems.  Three related subjects are the study of red dwarf stars, the search for exoplanetary atmospheres, and advancements in space telescope technologies.",
