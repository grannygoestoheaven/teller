  "clean_story": "\"Brain’s copy-paste trick.  Therapy that rewires empathy.\nMirror neuron therapy targets cells in your brain that act like tiny mimics—firing both when you do something and when you see someone else do it. Like a pianist’s fingers twitching while watching another play.\nThese neurons were first spotted in macaque monkeys in the 1990s. Researchers noticed the same brain areas lit up when a monkey grabbed a peanut or watched a human grab one. Humans have them too—clustered in areas tied to movement, emotion, and speech.\nHere’s the twist:In autism or post-stroke recovery, these neurons can misfire or go quiet. Therapy uses guided imitation exercises—like mirroring facial expressions or synchronized clapping—to reactivate them. Studies show 12 weeks of this can improve emotional recognition by 30% in autistic children.\nOne tool?EEG biofeedback caps that beep when brainwaves sync with a therapist’s. Patients learn to “tune” their neurons like adjusting a radio.\nThree related subjects are neuroplasticity limits, oxytocin’s role in trust, and AI mimicking mirror neurons.",
