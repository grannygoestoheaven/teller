  "clean_story": "Global internet highways. Hidden ocean habitats.\n\n\"Undersea cables\" are fiber-optic wires laid on the ocean floor—carrying 99% of intercontinental data.\n\n\nMost see them as silent data pipes. Few realize they’re artificial reefs.\n\nA cable’s concrete armor and steel mesh create nooks for barnacles, mussels, and tube worms. Over years, these clusters attract crabs, lobsters, and fish—like a sunken skyscraper’s lobby.\nOne study off Spain found 1,500 species on a single retired cable. Octopuses nest in the gaps. Conger eels coil around the casing.\n\nYet this isn’t accidental. Engineers now design \"reef-friendly\" cables with textured surfaces to boost marine life—turning infrastructure into habitat.\n\nThree related subjects are cable-laying ships, deep-sea mining impacts, and how whales use sound.",
