Calculating the cost of holding on. \"\n\n\"The math of moving on\" isn’t about numbers—it’s about trade-offs measured in time, energy, and missed opportunities.\n\nThink of it like a bank account where every memory, grudge, or \"what-if\" is a withdrawal. The longer you cling, the more interest you pay in stress, replayed conversations, or frozen decisions.\nStudies show the average person spends 14% of their mental energy daily revisiting past conflicts. That’s like running a marathon while carrying a backpack full of bricks—bricks you packed yourself.\nThe equation is simple:\nPain × Time = (Suffering) – (Lessons Learned).\nIf suffering grows but lessons don’t, the math turns toxic.\nExample: A 2020 Harvard study tracked people after breakups. Those who actively redirected their routine (new hobbies, rearranged furniture) recovered 3x faster than those who waited to \"feel ready. \"\nMoving on isn’t erasure—it’s reallocating resources. Like deleting old apps to free up phone storage. The space doesn’t vanish; it just becomes usable again.\nThree related subjects are sunk cost fallacy, neuroplasticity after loss, and rituals of closure.",
