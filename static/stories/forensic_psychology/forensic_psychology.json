  "clean_story": "\"Unraveling crimes. Understanding minds. The term 'forensic psychology' combines 'forensic,' meaning related to courts, and 'psychology,' the study of the mind. It’s like being a detective for the human brain, using science to solve puzzles in the legal world. \\nForensic psychology isn’t just about profiling criminals like in movies. It’s a field where experts analyze behavior, memories, and mental health to help courts make fair decisions. Imagine a psychologist working with police to figure out why someone committed a crime or helping a judge decide if a defendant is fit to stand trial. \\nOne key tool in forensic psychology is the use of psychological assessments. These aren’t like school tests—they’re detailed evaluations that measure things like intelligence, personality, or mental health. For example, a forensic psychologist might use these tests to determine if someone is telling the truth or if they have a condition that affects their actions. \\nForensic psychologists also work with victims, helping them cope with trauma and providing support during legal proceedings. They might assist in creating safe environments for witnesses to testify or help juries understand the psychological aspects of a case. \\nThis field is crucial in cases involving children, where understanding development and memory is key. For instance, a forensic psychologist might help determine if a child’s testimony is reliable or if they’ve been influenced by outside factors. \\nThree related subjects are the ethics of psychological testing, how memory can be unreliable in legal cases, and the role of psychology in rehabilitation programs for offenders. \"",
