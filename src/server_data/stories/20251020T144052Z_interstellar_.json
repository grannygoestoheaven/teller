  "clean": "Black holes.  Time dilation.  Quantum data.  Interstellar is a science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, released in 2014.  The narrative is centered around a future Earth facing severe ecological collapse.  Cooper, a former NASA pilot, is tasked with piloting the spacecraft Endurance through a wormhole near Saturn.  The mission's objective is to find a new habitable planet for humanity.  The film explores the concept of time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity.  As the crew visits different planets, they experience time at varying rates compared to Earth.  This is particularly evident on a planet near a supermassive black hole, where one hour equates to seven years on Earth.  The scientific accuracy in depicting these phenomena has been praised by physicists.  Interstellar also delves into the emotional and ethical dimensions of space exploration.  The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph is a central theme, highlighting the personal sacrifices involved.  The film raises questions about the moral implications of leaving Earth for survival.  It challenges viewers to consider the balance between scientific advancement and human values.  The visual effects in Interstellar were groundbreaking, particularly the depiction of the black hole, Gargantua.  The film's collaboration with physicist Kip Thorne ensured scientific authenticity, influencing real-world research.  Interstellar's impact extends beyond entertainment, sparking interest in astrophysics and space exploration.
