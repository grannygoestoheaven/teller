  "clean_story": "Searching for signals. Listening for life. The word 'SETI' stands for 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. ' It’s like tuning a giant radio to find a message from another world. SETI is the scientific effort to detect signs of intelligent life beyond Earth. Instead of looking for planets or stars, SETI scientists scan the cosmos for patterns that suggest technology, like radio waves or laser pulses, that don’t occur naturally. It’s like trying to hear a whisper in a crowded stadium, where most of the noise is from Earth’s own broadcasts. One of the most famous SETI projects is the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which used a massive radio telescope to listen for signals. Imagine a dish the size of 20 football fields, pointed at the sky, collecting faint whispers from distant stars. Scientists analyze these signals to see if they match patterns that could come from an intelligent source, like a repeating sequence or a frequency that’s unlikely to be natural. SETI isn’t just about listening. It also involves sending messages into space, like the Arecibo Message in 1974, which encoded basic information about humanity in a radio signal aimed at a star cluster. This was like sending a postcard into the universe, hoping someone might read it one day. Of course, SETI faces challenges. The universe is vast, and signals can get lost in the noise. It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack the size of the galaxy. But with advances in technology, like more sensitive telescopes and better data analysis, the search continues. Three related subjects are the Fermi Paradox, the challenges of interstellar communication, and the ethical questions of contacting alien civilizations.",
