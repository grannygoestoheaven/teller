  "clean_story": "Quantum entanglement, superconductivity, dark matter.  Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.  This non-local interaction challenges classical concepts of locality and causality.  Scientists have observed entanglement in various experiments, demonstrating its potential for quantum computing and secure communication.  Superconductivity is a state in which a material can conduct electricity without resistance, typically at very low temperatures.  This property allows for the creation of powerful electromagnets and efficient power transmission systems.  The discovery of high-temperature superconductors has opened new avenues for research, although a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon remains elusive.  Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects.  It constitutes approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy composition.  Despite extensive research, the exact nature of dark matter remains unknown, prompting ongoing investigations using advanced technology and methods.  Three related subjects are quantum computing, high-temperature superconductors, and cosmic microwave background radiation.",
