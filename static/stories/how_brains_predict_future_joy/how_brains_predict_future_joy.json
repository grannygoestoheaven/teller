  "clean_story": "Future happiness.  Brain’s hidden guesswork.\nThe phrase \"predicting joy\" isn’t about fortune-telling—it’s your brain acting like a weather forecaster, scanning past patterns to guess which choices might bring sunshine.\nYour brain doesn’t wait for joy to happen—it simulates it first. Like a chef tasting a dish before serving, your ventral striatum (a tiny reward hub) fires up when you imagine a pleasurable outcome, not just when you experience it.\nHere’s the trick: Your orbitofrontal cortex—the brain’s \"comparison shopper\"—pulls memories of past rewards (a laugh with friends, the taste of pizza) and mixes them with current clues (a text invitation, the smell of tomato sauce). If the mental \"recipe\" feels promising, your brain nudges you toward that choice before you’re fully aware.\nExample: Ever picked a vacation spot because your brain flashed a memory of warm sand—before you even checked the weather? That’s prediction in action.\nBut it’s not foolproof. Stress or fatigue scramble the signals, like static on a radio—suddenly, your brain might misfile a risky bet as \"exciting\" instead of \"dangerous. \"\nThree related subjects are dopamine’s role in imagination, how nostalgia shapes decisions, and why some brains overpredict joy.",
